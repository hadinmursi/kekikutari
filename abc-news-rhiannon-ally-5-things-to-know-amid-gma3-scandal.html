The reporters have not addressed the snaps or their <a href=#>alleged relationship</a>.

Amy and T.J. didn‚Äôt seem like they were trying to keep their relationship secret anymore, everyone around the office could tell there was a spark between them for many months.‚Äù</p><p>Executives of the network <a href=#>made the ultimate decision to pull</a> the Michigan native and the Arkansas native from the morning show in early December, citing their relationship as an ‚Äúinternal and external distraction.‚Äù ABC has not addressed when or if the original anchors <a href=#>will return to the program</a>.</p><p>Ally, for her part, began her journalism career in the Midwest as a morning anchor and won an Emmy for her work in local news. The Missouri native joined ABC News in December 2021 as a freelance correspondent and substitute anchor. In August, the network announced that Ally was named coanchor for ABC World News Now and America This Morning.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Mommy, Please Don‚Äôt Go to Work! author made her first appearance on Good Morning America in November. ‚ÄúMy first time in studio for @goodmorningamerica,‚Äù Ally wrote <a href=#>via Instagram</a> at the time. ‚ÄúThank you @robinrobertsgma @michaelstrahan for the warm welcome!
