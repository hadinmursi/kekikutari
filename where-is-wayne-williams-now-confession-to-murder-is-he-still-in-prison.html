The first vehicle to leave the site was Williams’. Furthermore, when the police stopped and questioned him, he said he was going to meet a singer before an audition. The suspect became even stronger when he gave the phone number of the singer that turned out to be a fake one.</p><p>Later, the authorities discovered Nathaniel’s body in a few days. In fact, Williams failed the polygraph test three times. Hairs and fibers were found on Jimmy’s body that matched Williams’ god, car, and home. Furthermore, there were many inconsistencies in William’s statements. When the police cross-questioned him, he got agitated and angry. He was found guilty of the murders of the two men after a trial that lasted for two months. Williams had filed a petition for a retrial which was denied.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-he-still-in-prison></span>Is He Still In Prison?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Williams is still in prison.</p><p>Wiliams is in his sixties today.
