He has attained a net worth of $7.5 Million. Hein was born in New York in 1967 and is now settled with his wife and two daughters. He has passed out from the University of Michigan. While he was a student there, he also appeared in a series of short comedy troupe named “Comedy Company” along with John Glaser. Hein and Glaser became a part of the comedy group “Just Kidding”.</p><p>Jon’s wealth comes from the success he has achieved by creating the website jumptheshark.com apart from his performances. Jumping the Shark is an idiom which was coined by Hein to refer to that phase of time when the quality of television shows deteriorated, and it was considered beyond recovery. It is also used to refer to the time when the writer forcibly uses something irrelevant like a cheap gimmick to retain the interest of viewers. This name at one of time became the code word between Hein and his friends. This is why he decided to keep it as the name of his website. In 2006, he sold the company to Gemstar for 1 million dollar. There was however speculations that he actually sold the website for anything between 5-10 million dollars.</p><p>Jon Hein is now working with the Howard Stern Show. Some staff members here always knew that Hein would be a good host for the program – The Wrap-Up Show. Although he is high on diabetic, still he refuses to give up junk food. Once live on air, he admitted that he checks his insulin level only so that he can gorge on junk food items.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfo3qpscinqmaamaS0s63PobBmnpGYwW6vwKucnqpdlsSivsOsZKedpGLEsL7ToWSloZaaerTAzquwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
