We’ve trained for years and years and years and years.”</span></p><p><a href=#>Rio beach day ?</a></p><p>A post shared by Simone Biles (@simonebiles) on Aug 20, 2016 at 2:23pm PDT</p><p><span>“It’s not something you just like eat healthy for a week and it happens,” she continued. “It’s all in moderation. Like, we had pizza for lunch today.” (As Raisman detailed her fitness regimen, Biles whispered into Hernandez’s ear that she doesn’t work out for an hour each day.)</span></p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=563 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When pressed about <a href=#>her flirting on Twitter with the Oakland Raiders’ <b>Colton Underwood</b></a>&nbsp;after he asked her on a double date, Raisman kept coy and explained, “It’s [my friend and fellow gymnast] <b>Shawn [Johnson]</b>’s husband’s teammate and they’re also roommates, so I haven’t met him actually before. But I don’t know. I’m not sure yet. He is [really cute].”</p><p><span>Speaking of boys, the gymnasts also opened about their celeb crushes. Asked if she thought meeting </span><b>Zac Efron</b><span> superseded winning multiple gold medals at this year’s Summer Games, Biles stated without hesitation that placing first definitely trumped meeting (and planting a smooch on!) the hunky 28-year-old actor. “Yeah, that’s like the next best thing,” she told&nbsp;</span><i>Us</i><span>.</span></p><p><span>The decorated athlete <a href=#>finally got some face time with the <i>High School Musical</i> alum</a>, which she documented via Instagram on August 16. “On cloud 9 💙☁️ &nbsp;@zacefron,” Biles captioned an adorable GIF. In the clip, the gymnast kisses Efron on the cheek.</span></p><p><span>Biles is also into eternal heartthrob <b>Usher</b>. Asked who the last celeb was to leave her starstruck besides Efron, the gymnastics champ excitedly told <i>Us</i> about her recent run-in with the R&B crooner: “Today we met Usher … We told him we were going to see his movie [Hands of Stone] coming out Friday!”</span></p><p><span>Added Raisman, “He kissed us on the cheek and he wore my medal!”</span></p><p>To see the Final Five act out their favorite emojis, watch the video above!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapKliv6K10qaYp2WTpLultdOipqerXZ2ys3nIp6qappVirqO%2FjJ%2Bmq2WRqXqtscCsq2aZnmK1sMHRZphmnJGueriAkm5wbm5f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
