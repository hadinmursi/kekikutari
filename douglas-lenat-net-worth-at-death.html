Before Cyc, Lenat significantly advanced AI through the creation of AM (Automated Mathematician) and EURISKO in the 1970s. Unlike EURISKO, which served as a general-purpose learning program for multiple areas, AM concentrated on uncovering new mathematical facts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfqrStrdJmo56mkal6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqLAjJ2cmqyYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
