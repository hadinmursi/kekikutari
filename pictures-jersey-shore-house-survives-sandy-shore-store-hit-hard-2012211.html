But the Shore Store, where the cast was employed during the series’ run, is another story.</p><p>Pictures of the clothing shop after Sandy show significant damage to both the surrounding property and the building itself. The rolling steel doors in front of the store have been bashed in by wind, and the section of boardwalk around it is in shambles. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reports that the superstorm also caused severe water damage to a lot of the merchandise and equipment inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Sandy devastated us,” shop owner Danny Merk told <a href=#>ABC News</a> from Florida, where he was helping his family run a chain of Halloween stores. Merk also owns the Jersey Shore house and several other properties in town.</p><p>“I saw some pictures people sent me. My store’s gates are crashed in. There’s no boardwalk. I don’t even understand how bad it is yet.”</p><p>Merk, 32, added that the damage was especially devastating given the area’s increasing popularity and prosperity in recent years.</p><p>“We were on such a high after the show,” he explained. “We were the town on the rise, a freight train, a roller coaster. It’s just a terrible thing.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He and his family are eager to rebuild, though. “We’re going to buy supplies here in Florida and we’re going to come there with plywood and drywall and attack it, do the best job we can possibly do,” he said.</p><p>The Jersey Shore cast members are doing their part, too. All have called Merk to check in and are asking their followers on Twitter to donate to the Red Cross.</p><p>“Devastation doesn’t last forever,” <a href=#><strong>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</strong></a> <a href=#>tweeted</a> Wednesday, Oct. 31. “We can and will rebuild! Thinking about my second family at the Jersey Shore.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapoZOpwrOx0mahnqqjmsZuv8eoqZ5lmKTCtLGMrKyrrpmrsrR50pqlnbFdqLWwvsRmqq2nopp6qbXTZp%2BaqpRif3F9kWtoamc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
