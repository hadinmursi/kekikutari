As long as viewers are hesitant to go deeper, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mr. Queen</a> is an entertaining drama shining with charm. An earlier drama story point makes it evident that So-yong’s soul is still present in the body, which helps to explain why So-yong is drawn to Cheol-Jong.</p><p>So-Bong’s attraction to Cheol-jong can avoid being classified as homosexual because So-Yong’s memories and feelings for Cheol-jong coexist with So-Bong’s soul. <strong>Therefore, Mr. Queen Is Not Gay.</strong></p><p>The performance and chemistry of the characters carry the drama’s humor with ease, making for a humorous and captivating watch. Nonetheless, the mixed-gender scenario raises concerns in its attempts to prevent a gay relationship between the leads.</p><p>The idea’s subtle beauty lies in the fact that the show may take either position without worrying about alienating its largely still-conservative audience.</p><p>Shin Hae Sun and Kim Jung Hyun complement one another incredibly well, which helps Cheolbong go from foes to allies to lovers. Since their friendship serves as the center of the drama, it is shocking when Bong Hwan is replaced by So Yong in the climactic scene.</p><p>Nonetheless, some fans were still upset with the conclusion because So-yong wasn’t shown to be gay. Mr. Queen had the chance to go against the grain and take a chance and to convey to the viewers that love is not limited by our gender or physical characteristics.</p><p>What is important is who you truly are within your soul. Conversely, the writers decided to devalue their own creation by omitting their love story and hero in order to conform to the heteronormative ideal.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Is Robin Thicke Gay?

He was able to confirm that he had actually contributed to Cheol-jong being remembered as a reformer and a revered monarch as opposed to a dunce and puppet king.</p><p>While the rest of the world was unaffected, this altered both his past and Cheoljong’s future. Once “Mr. Queen” came to a conclusion, Bong-Hwan returned to his work free of scandal while assisting So-Yong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happens in the Last Episode of Mr. Queen?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2021-02-14-at-92608-pm.jpg><p>Many viewers were left with mixed emotions by “Mr. Queen’s” shocking and unexpected ending.
