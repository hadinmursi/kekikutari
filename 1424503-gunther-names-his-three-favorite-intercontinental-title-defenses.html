My family was there and stuff like that. It was, overall a really awesome experience. I would say, Chad Gable, it felt good. I love an underdog scenario like the David and Goliath scenario.</p><p>“Who would be number three? Clash at the Castle is good. But I already mentioned Sheamus and he doesn’t deal too well with too much attention. So I can’t mention him again. Well, I think Drew the thing is SummerSlam against Drew. I think it was a match I was really proud of as well. Because Drew is such an established guy in WWE. And if you look at his story, it’s very impressive.</p><p>“I think he was the young guy that got kicked, but he wasn’t like, I’ll let it be. He grit his teeth and worked himself up again. And then he worked himself up to the he was the champion. He beat Brock at WrestleMania. And even though nobody was there was still WrestleMania. He figured out a way to like really belong in that top picture of the company.</p><p>“It’s like they would see Drew McIntyre. Okay, that guy. People turn around when that guy enters a room, right? So yeah, so being in the ring with him and having that kind of match with him at SummerSlam. I really liked that. It was like it for me. It was a big test to have to match with Drew. And just to see if I can, yeah, just hang with him in there on that stage and have a matchup and magnitude.”</p><p><a href=#>Gunther On Match With The Miz At Survivor Series: It Will Be A Clash Of Styl</a></p><p>What do you make of Gunther’s comments?
