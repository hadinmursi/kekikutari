It has been on repeat in our home. The truth of these songs is blessing us every day,” she wrote via her Instagram Story on February 18. “These are songs that we have loved in our family for years and each hold a special place to us. We hope they can bless you and meet you wherever you are at God is good. We are learning to praise Him in the valley and the mountaintop all the same.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalmaWnrm65xKupoqykYsSiuMqeqWagn6O8s7%2BMrKanZaeewal5wp6jnpqilsGqu81mpp9lnJ6zpnnAn6ueql2ZsqLAx2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
