Padma Lakshmi has a stern message to deliver to a handful of social media users who criticized her for appearing without a bra in a cooking tutorial she shared via her Instagram account earlier this month amid the coronavirus crisis.
“I got some comments last time that it was immoral for me to not wear a bra in my own kitchen during the quarantine,” the Top Chef host, 49, quipped in a new Instagram cooking video shared on Monday, April 13."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In that clip, which was shared via Instagram on Friday, April 10, the culinary pro is wearing a gray dress, seemingly without a bra underneath.</p><p>“Is no one going to comment on why she feels the need to put her nipples on social media in every video? No?” one Instagram user wondered in the comments. “Just sad.”</p><p>Another user took note of Lakshmi’s quarantine outfit and wrote: “She has no bra on. Well that made the cooking tutorial much more interesting😂👍.”</p><p>As India native promised, she is in fact wearing two sports bras in Monday’s video, during which she showed her followers how to make lasagna with white ragu.</p><p>Additionally, many of her followers showed their support in the comments of her most recent how-to — bra or no bra. “LET THOSE PUPPIES HANG PADMA,” declared one commenter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another took issue with a certain word some naysayers used to attack the earlier post. “Immoral? I literally made dinner tonight with no pants.”</p><p>The fact that Lakshmi took her critics to task is no surprise, especially since she’s been <a href=#>very open about how comfortable she is with her body</a> in recent months. “I haven’t had time to diet, so I’m about 146 pounds right now,” she told Us Weekly exclusively on the Emmy Awards red carpet in September 2019. “I’m lucky because I gained weight exponentially, everywhere. I don’t care. I was just happy there was a dress this pretty that fit,” she said of the ethereal blue Christian Siriano gown she wore to the ceremony. “And at the end of the day it’s just about feeling comfortable. I’m done trying to squeeze my bum into something that is too small. I don’t care.”</p><p>The Tangy, Tart, Hot and Sweet author continued: “You know, it shouldn’t be about what I look like at this point in my career.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqmZlKKubrjApKqhpZlisK2tz6xkm5mToHqistOeqWabn6S4qrrGZquurJ%2BntqK4jJypoqyZmLa0uY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
