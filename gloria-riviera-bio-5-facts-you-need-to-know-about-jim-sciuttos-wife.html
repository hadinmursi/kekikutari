They are both brilliant journalists doing well in their career. This article centers on the biography of Gloria Riviera and interesting facts about her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=gloria-riviera-bio></span><strong>Gloria Riviera: Bio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are different assumptions with respect to the date of the birth of the media personality. Some sources say 1975, while others claim 1974. Gloria Riviera is yet to confirm which of the date is really true. Although her birth year may be in doubt, it is an established fact that she was born in Idaho, in the United States to Charlotte and Daniel&nbsp; Riviera.</p><p>The young Gloria grew up in the neighbourhood of her birth and she attended Phillips Exeter Academy high school in New Hampshire. She later proceeded to Princeton University where she majored in English Literature. While at the college, she joined the school’s ice hockey team. On graduation from the varsity, she immediately returned back to school for her Master’s degree in Journalism which she bagged from the New York University.</p><p>Upon graduation, Gloria worked for BBC News briefly before she joined ABC News in 1999 where she served as a junior reporter until her big break came in 2004. Her impressive reporting soon earned her career promotion, as she was made the NewsOne correspondent covering a larger spectrum. With her newly appointed position, it afforded her the opportunity of travelling to a lot of places, chasing after the news within and outside the US. She resided five years in London before she and her family moved to Beijing, China, where she continued to work as the ABC News Asia Correspondent while her husband was the Chief of staff to Gary Locke, the former U.S. Ambassador to China. One year down the line, Gloria Riviera returned to Washington D.C where she still hones her skill as a correspondent for ABC News.</p><p>She would be most remembered for her work reporting on many disaster and conflict stories like the terrorist attack of 9/11, the falling of the twin towers, the U.S invasion of Iraq, the 2004 U.S presidential campaign, the Hurricane Katrina, and Sewol Ferry disaster in South Korea where she had to spent nine days covering the incident. She also played a pivotal role in the update and coverage of the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH-370. What’s more, Gloria Riviera has been featured on Good Morning America, World News, and Nightline.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=5-facts-you-need-to-know-about-jim-sciuttos-wife></span><strong>5 Facts You Need To Know About Jim Sciutto’s Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>1.
