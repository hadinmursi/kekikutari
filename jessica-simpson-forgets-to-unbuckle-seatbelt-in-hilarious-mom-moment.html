Even when it felt impossible, I chose to work harder.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjKygpqijpLtuss6rnp6so2LBsHnUp5mum5uhsm6%2FxJqrm52cqXqquoyhoKWZop68tr%2BMpqamZZ2kuqa602g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
