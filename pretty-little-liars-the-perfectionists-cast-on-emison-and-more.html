“Alison is trying to be a better person and prove to her family that she’s going to make a difference. Then she finds herself with Mona,” Pieterse, 23, says."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not for long. <a href=#>Pretty Little Liars</a> OGs <a href=#><strong>Janel Parrish</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sasha Pieterse</strong></a> open up in the new issue of Us Weekly about what to expect from the mysterious new drama Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists – and what to keep an eye out for.</p><p>“Alison is <a href=#>trying to be a better person</a> and prove to her family that she’s going to make a difference. Then she finds herself with Mona,” Pieterse, 23, says. However, Mona’s in over her head in Beacon Heights, the town where Alison has landed a T.A. job. And when the first murder happens, everyone’s lives are turned upside down.</p><p>“Once this happens, you see the masks pull away, and Ali and Mona have to latch onto each other,” Parrish, 30, notes. “They form this amazing friendship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pretty-little-liars-11.jpg><p>While Pieterse and Parrish were excited to lead the new drama, original fans have many questions about Alison’s other half, Emily (<a href=#><strong>Shay Mitchell</strong></a>) — who is not part of the spinoff – and their twins.</p><p>“Emily and the babies are definitely heavy on Alison’s mind, but they have a lot to navigate in their relationship and process what’s happened,” Pieterse notes. “Alison gets this amazing opportunity, and her plan is to become a professor and then go back and teach at Hollis so she can be close to her family.”</p><p>Creator <strong>I. Marlene King</strong> also adds that Emison fans are “very important” to her and to everyone at Freeform. “We wanted to make sure that we dealt with that story line in a truthful way, regarding their history and where we last left them,” she says. “It’s a story line that Alison embraces over several episodes.”</p><p><strong>Sofia Carson</strong> is new to the series, playing Ava, a mysterious student who runs a fashion blog and has a dark past. For Carson, 25, she couldn’t be happier to join the PLL family – and was shocked by the scripts week after week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pretty-little-liars-21.jpg><p>“After the pilot, I didn’t know how they’d top it. Second episode topped it, third episode topped that. After reading the fourth, I was shocked,” the Descendants star says. “Marlene said to me, ‘Hold on, you’re in for a ride.’ It truly doesn’t stop.”</p><p>While new fans are welcome – you don’t need to know the history of Pretty Little Liars to understand The Perfectionists – there are Easter eggs for longtime fans, sprinkled throughout the show. In fact, PLL fans should “pay attention to the sets,” Parrish notes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Read our full interviews with the cast the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now, plus watch the video above.</p><p>Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists premieres on Freeform Wednesday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKernaSpxm64yK2rpZ1dobaivtJmq6GdXaWys7LEnKuip56ewLW%2FjJyYrKxdpLtuscyiqqimXZa7pXnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
