The "How I Feel" singer, 32, looked skinnier than ever during an event celebrating The Voice's Top 12 contestants on Thursday, Nov. 7, at Universal Studios in L.A.</p><p>Posing on the red carpet with host <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Carson Daly</strong></a> and fellow judges <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Adam Levine</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Cee Lo Green</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, the petite blonde showed off her recent <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> in tight black skinny jeans and a white blouse with silver beading. She added some height to her frame with sky-high platform peep-toes.</p><p>Asked about her slim-down secrets during the Q&A part of the evening, Aguilera answered vaguely, telling reporters she was just grateful to have had a break from the show to do her own thing. (The Burlesque star took the fourth season off to record a new album; she was temporarily replaced by <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Shakira</strong></a>.)</p><p>"You know, it's a lot of stagnant energy sitting in a chair for three years, and I was excited at the chance I got to finally have a break to spend time with my son and do things that fulfill me," the mom of one explained. (She has a 5-year-old little boy, <strong>Max</strong>, with ex-husband <strong>Jordan Bratman</strong>.) "Honestly, I feel like when you get a moment to just breathe, and experience life, especially as an artist, it's hard to sit down and not be an artist for a while and not be a mom."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: "It's life, you know, just being able to breathe and have time away [from] the camera to get to the nitty gritty of all things real and personal and appreciate life so you come back refreshed."</p><p>"You look incredible," Voice host Daly piped in. "We appreciate you kept your boobs."</p><p>"Oh. My. God," a taken-aback Aguilera replied as Daly continued to thank her for preserving at least a few of her curves. "Some things never change." Later, as she was leaving the stage, she added (somewhat ironically), "Thanks for that comment!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZpkmp%2BlnrmmvsBmo6inm6h6tLfIp6WinaJiwamtzWacr52iYq61edWooJydXZrDprrTZp%2Baq12WxKzDwKubZqWforKvwIyamaitpGK1pr6Mm6aomqNixKrAx2aamqqjpLtusMClsGZqYGaAeX2QaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
