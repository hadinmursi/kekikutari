"He had brought an original hangdog expression to his character and was just damn funny. He was also the first one of us to shoot a commercial, be on 'The Tonight Show,' buy a house, get his own movie. He was the hot guy that first year, and rightly so.

Well, David Schwimmer didn't forget the moment given that he was completely embarrassed by what had taken place. Schwimmer was excited to be sharing the stage with iconic actor Sean Penn who was guest-starring on the show alongside Lisa Kudrow.

Given the chemistry on the main cast, success of the show and live audience, it made for a tense environment for guest stars.</p><p>According to director Kevin S. Bright, that was especially the case for Sean Penn. His storyline alongside Lisa Kudrow was forgettable and in addition, <a href=#>Penn looked uncomfortable on the Friends set</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think the least successful one was Sean Penn on the show,’ Kevin exclusively told Metro.co.uk. ‘Just the style of the production wasn’t what he was used to, doing a show like that, so there was a little deer in the headlight affect."</p><p>At the very least, Bright would go on to reveal that getting the guest stars on the show wasn't difficult given the show's success.</p><p>"It worked out that it was easy because we didn’t have to come up for parts to suit the cast; we had actors coming to us saying they wanted to be on the show so there were really parts written for them knowing they wanted to do the show."</p><p>Clearly, there were many ups and downs with guest stars, but getting them on board wasn't a tough task.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXq0r8ewoKallad6uK3SZpymmpGnv6K%2F0p6bZqyfYsCpu86tZKyblaOytHnWoquhZaOarq95z56lp2Wfo3qnvsiepZ2rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
