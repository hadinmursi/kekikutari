So I think, first and foremost, it’s that and genetics.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Pregnant-Chloe-Sevigny-Shows-Bare-Baby-Bump-in-Bikini-Pic.jpg><p>The Oscar nominee added, “And then I’m really into all the things they tell you to do, like moisturizing. I go to Dr. Colbert, who is this fancy dermatologist. I haven’t really gone the Botox route yet, but he does lasers and very expensive facials and stuff like that.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with Mackovic, Sevigny was linked to <a href=#><strong>Luka Sabaat</strong></a>. “I remember seeing this beautiful boy and being totally struck,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a> in February 2019 of the model, 22. “He smiled at me and I melted. I was like, ‘Who is this kid?’ To me, it’s not about his style. It’s more about his energy and his vibe. I feel like it’s the same with me: People are always like, ‘Oh, she’s a style icon.’ But it’s like, there’s gotta be something else, you know?”</p><p>The Golden Globe winner winner started acting in 1995 and is best known for her roles in independent films, including American Psycho, as well as HBO’s Big Love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aaoaSfmnq0sdWinqexXai1sMPSZpmamqlir7a5z2agp2WSnriqushmp6KbXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
