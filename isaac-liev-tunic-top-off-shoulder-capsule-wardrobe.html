We donated so many things after Tidying Up debuted on Netflix and have been trying to live by that “spark joy” philosophy ever since, but no matter how much we give away, we’re still running out of empty hangers constantly!</p><p>That’s why we’ve decided to shift our focus to more <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">pieces that can do it all</a>. We’re looking to the capsule wardrobe trend for inspiration, buying pieces we adore that can be mixed, matched and worn for a variety of occasions so we can stick with one versatile piece instead of five different ones. One piece that matches that description? <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">This Isaac Liev top</a>, available on Amazon!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Isaac Liev Tunic Top</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$8</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, January 28, 2021, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">This tunic top </a>is elegant but not stuffy. It’s breezy but not thin or beachy. It’s oversized but not baggy. It’s flattering but not tight. It’s everything we were looking for. Even the fabric itself is soft and stretchy, and the way it drapes? Seriously dreamy. The asymmetrical hem has a fluid, waterfall-like movement to it, while the batwing, three-quarter sleeves add to the chic silhouette and overall cozy comfort of the piece.</p><p>Another aspect of this tunic that really makes it a winner is the neckline. Let it fall off one shoulder or pull it down a bit to expose the tops of both depending on the occasion and your overall look. This leaves room for some fun accessorizing with necklaces too. How about <a href=# rel=noopener>this healing necklace</a>?</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Isaac Liev Tunic Top</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$8</a> at Amazon!
