It might seem strange to think that the guy whose reputation suggests he's a bit of a playboy would care what 'Playgirl' thought of him. The truth is, however, that Leo was so unhappy with the publication's plans for his image that he took them all the way to court.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What These Popular '90s Heartthrobs Are Doing Today</a></span></p><p>For fans who are picturing&nbsp;actual images of Leonardo DiCaprio, that's exactly how 'Playgirl' earned the actor's ire. To be fair, perhaps the struggling '70s-era magazine thought that printing photos of Leonardo would boost their readership. Either way, the formerly defunct magazine relaunched in late 2020, but their history is riddled with some drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tampa Bay</a> reported back in 2005, DiCaprio sued the magazine in 1998 because they had planned to publish private photos of him. At the time, of course, Leo was 23 and had girls chasing him down the street every time he ventured out in public.</p><p>It may have been pre-paper-bag-disguise for DiCaprio, but he was insanely famous even then, so the attention was probably a bit overwhelming. Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DiCaprio doesn't typically have bodyguards on his staff</a>, he clearly felt the need to keep a low profile.</p><p>Plus, when it came to rumors about 'Playgirl' publishing the "offensive and objectionable" pictures, Leonardo just wasn't having that invasion of his privacy. He sought an injunction, noted&nbsp;Tampa Bay, which outlined the fact that the photographs featured a full frontal view of the unclothed actor.</p><p>What's more, the editor in chief at the time resigned in protest over the owners' plans to publish Leo's compromising photographs.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffalo News</a> quoted her as saying that the plans went against her ethics and that she wouldn't be associated with such a move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the executives of 'Playgirl' claim that the editor in chief was actually fired, not that she had quit, though it didn't provide a reason for her firing, nor did they confirm the plans to publish Leo's photos.</p><p>Though Leo sought "unspecified damages," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NNDB</a> suggests that the lawsuit was settled "almost immediately" for an amount that was also unspecified. Fortunately, afterward, Leonardo was able to avoid further drama, at least in terms of revealing photographs.</p><p>He's had plenty of interesting headlines written about him — and photos taken of him — since that lawsuit. However, none of them have been particularly compromising, unless fans count his string of model girlfriends that just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">may have ended with his current love, Camila Morrone</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio Said He Wishes He Could've Played This Mark Wahlberg Role</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdobKwusCrm6hllJ6worzRoqZmq6WasW68y5qwoKGioXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
