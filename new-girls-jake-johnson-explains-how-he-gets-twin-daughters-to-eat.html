Jake Johnson has an out-of-the-box way of getting his and Erin Payne’s 6-year-old twin daughters to eat.
“I’ve been with my kids a ton during this break [amid the coronavirus pandemic], and I find myself cooking meals,” the New Girl alum, 42, told Kelly Clarkson of his kids on Tuesday, August 25. “Cooking meals for kids is such a thankless gift.”
When the American Idol alum, 38, agreed, saying she feels “like a short-order cook” to her two kids, Johnson shared his latest dinnertime trick."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They’ll say, ‘I like the texture, but I don’t like the cheese on the quesadilla,’ and I’ll be like, ‘Thank you, judge. How about you?’”</p><p>Since the little ones “aren’t great” with numbers, the actor has developed a sauce system for meal rankings. “If you really like something, it’s extra sauce,” Johnson told Clarkson. “If you don’t like it, the sauce was bad. That’s how we’ve been doing it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The host gushed that he should write a parenting book, saying, “I can get my girl, [River], to eat anything especially if I bribe her with some kind of treat afterward, but my son, [Remington], will starve.

That’s actually breaking New Girl news. That’s breaking news. That was <strong>Liz Meriwether</strong>‘s call. Not mine. She’s the creator of the show. The character’s name was Mitchtrubisky. One word.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGannaditKq%2By6xko5mbmnqru8enqqimXZrFsbjAoqWsZZikxG60xGaenqyjYsG4tc1mm5qtl53Bpr7SZquoZZWWwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
