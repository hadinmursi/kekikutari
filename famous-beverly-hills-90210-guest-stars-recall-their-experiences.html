And while there was plenty of drama onscreen, some of the behind-the-scenes tales from the set have continued to make headlines years after the show wrapped.</p><p>Doherty and Garth, for example, have been open about <a href=#>their rocky relationship</a> during the first four seasons of the series.</p><p>“We were locked in this sound stage for 14-16 hours every day,” the What I Like About You star wrote in her 2014 Book, Deep Thoughts From a Hollywood Blonde. “There were times when we loved each other and there were times when we wanted to claw each other’s eyes out … It was more of just young girls finding their way and finding their individual voices. … Poor Tori, the youngest of the three of us was, inevitably, often caught in the middle and she was always trying to smooth things over.”</p><p>Garth later recalled a physical fight with Doherty during an appearance on <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in August 2019.</a></p><p>“I can only remember one incident and that was when, yeah, we took it outside,” she said. “I’m a midwestern girl. I spent some time in Glendale, Arizona, and that makes you tough.”</p><p>Spelling provided more context of the altercation. “You guys were teasing each other and she, like, pulled your skirt up,” she told<a href=#><strong> Andy Cohen.</strong></a> “I stayed in my dressing room when it was happening, shaking.”</p><p>During an interview with Us Weekly, however, the True Tori alum <a href=#>noted that Doherty “had an unfair rap” all these years.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She took it and took it like a champ. Once they gave her that label, it lived with her, her whole career, and that’s unfortunate,” Spelling said while promoting the show’s short-lived quasi-revival, BH90210, which aired in 2019. “I know what it’s like to get a label of something and that’s the one story that stays with you forever, and it just wasn’t true.”</p><p>While Spelling, Garth, Green and Ziering were the only original cast members to stay on for the show’s entire 10-season run, several famous faces were featured on the series over the years — and <a href=#>they’ve also been candid about their experience.</a></p><p>Scroll through to read <strong><a href=#>Jessica Alba</a>, <a href=#>Hilary Swank</a>, <a href=#>David Arquette</a></strong> and more had to say about their time in the iconic zip code:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bbrq671Kxkm52mmr%2BtxYyhoKWko2KGcX6QaWSgrZWowW6%2F05qprGWimrCiuMtmq6Gdmad6psTPnqminZ6YsrR7z5qspWWapLWiutKspqdlYmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
