He began his music career signing to Birdman's Cash Money Records in 1994 at the age of 13 B.G. may be released early from his 14-year prison sentence being served in a California penitentiary. According to reports, Birdman announced during an Instagram Live that his former Cash Money signee could be home in a “few” weeks” — way ahead of his projected release date of April 7, 2024.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>BSB Comeback: 20 Things About The Backstreet Boys Only True Fans Know</b></a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Vibe</i></a>, Back in September, Birdman did share an update on his Instagram account regarding B.G.’s release status. He said, “Be home in a minute,” the Cash Money Records co-founder wrote as he tagged the 42-year-old’s IG.</p><p>B.G., born Christopher Noel Dorsey, is currently serving a 14-year sentence in federal prison after pleading guilty to gun possession and witness tampering in 2012. His sentence stemmed from a 2009 arrest in New Orleans when police discovered three firearms—two of which were stolen—in B.G.’s possession during a traffic stop.</p><p>Earlier this year, Birdman penned a letter to the “Bling Bling” rapper’s judge advocating for his release. At the time, Baby wrote: “He is not only a generational artist, but he’s got a platform and the chance to share his experience to better today’s young men who need to hear what he’s got to say. When he is released, I know he will give back and use what he’s gone through to help as many people as possible.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In September, U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan rejected a motion submitted by another federal prisoner, urging to have the New Orleans rapper’s sentence shortened. The same judge also denied a June gesture asking for his release with supporting letters from Birdman, his brother Slim, Wendy Day, and more.</p><p>One of B.G.’s motions dating back to February outlined health issues that could easily make him susceptible to COVID-19. However, all of B.G.’s attempts for an early release have been denied.</p><p>Upon B.G.’s arrest in 2012, he issued a letter to all of his fans which can be read below.</p><p><i>To: “My Fans”</i></p><p><i>From: B.
