The 47-year-old actress said her daughter, Sarina McFarlane, now 23, became ill six years ago with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. “It presented itself for a really bad case of food poisoning,” Wilson said on Good Morning America on Thursday, March 30."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When you are the parent of someone who is a chronic pain sufferer, you end up creating these binders for all of the hospital stays so you can keep track of every visit and any new thing that comes out.”</p><p>After 10 months, McFarlane was diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS for short), which causes episodes of severe vomiting and exhaustion. It’s extremely difficult to diagnose, and there’s currently no cure or way to successfully manage the pain.</p><p>“The name gave a direction to go in,” Wilson said. “And it put us in a community of people that seriously were going through the exact same thing stage by stage.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p>Wilson directed a season 9 episode of <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> in 2012 that explored CVS and the struggle to diagnose the condition. “Being able to be on <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> with all of those people able to watch it and hear it and say, ‘Oh my God. That’s what that is. I’ve heard of that. That’s my kid. That’s my husband. That’s my aunt,’” she explained. “That’s something that I can do sitting in this chair on the set, then my daughter has said, ‘Go ahead. Go and do that.’”</p><p>Although the family has dealt with the medical saga for years, Wilson is speaking out now because her daughter has recently started having episodes again after the illness was dormant.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGjsbOtjLCgpaufo3qwvMSnqmatoGKuo7vUrWSdmaWctbWx0axkpp2UnrCiuIymsKyslafGbsOTcGtraWRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
