Flair came out and acknowledged the rumors that he was there to announce his retirement. Flair said he’s been away for over 6 months and has had a chance to look back on his career. He compared himself to sports legends Cal Ripken and Bret Favre – both of whom competed at the highest level despite their advanced age. Flair said that he’ll NEVER retire from wrestling. He will be in this business until the day he dies. Vince McMahon then came down to the ring. He said that Ric Flair will be able to compete in WWE until his next loss. Vince said he doesn’t care if Flair wins his matches by pinfall, submission, countout or disqualification. Flair will be allowed to compete until he loses his match. The first match he loses, he will be forced to retire.</p><p>In addition to Jeff Hardy vs. Triple H at Armageddon, they also announced Mr. Kennedy vs. HBK and Finlay vs. The Great Khali for the PPV.</p><p>Wow, who’d Brian Kendrick piss off to get squashed like that?
