Being completely selfish for once. Never thought I’d get to such a low point … But as of today, i had no single wish to see tomorrow.. But God saved me for a reason, and for that… I must be grateful.. Cuz I’m not in heaven right now for a reason.”</span></p><p><span>The R&B singer-songwriter also revealed that her ex-boyfriend, <b>PND</b>, was the one to save her from her suicide attempt. (The rumors of Parrish cheating on Cavaliers superstar Irving started after PND posted a pic of himself holding her hand in bed.)</span></p><p>The Oakland, California, native first experienced the spotlight as a contestant on season 6 of <i>America’s Got Talent,</i> where she met host Cannon. She finished in fourth place. In a May 2015 interview with <i><a href=#>Billboard</a>,</i> the “Did I” singer shared the entrepreneur’s profound influence on her life.&nbsp;</p><p><span>“Before Nick Cannon, I was homeless,” she said at the time. “I was just in Oakland, I had one song out, and I had never really written too much before. He came from a standpoint of someone I had met a long time ago on <i>America’s Got Talent.</i> He saw my potential back then and he waited around to see what I grew into, and he saw a young girl who needed some help in the area where no one should really be struggling. Simple things like having a place to lay my head and having a safe place to write music. He really gave me that. He gave me a place to rest my head. As a young woman not having a father figure or any type of supportive male role in your life, that’s what he gave to me. He was kind of like a father figure.”</span></p><p>Cannon didn’t only reach out to the singer on Tuesday. He rushed to be by her side. “Had to go grab my Youngen!” the father of two shared on Instagram, alongside a snap of himself hugging Parrish in her hospital room. “#Family #LoveHug #NeverLettingGo #NeverLeavingHerSide #IGotYouForLife #UsAgainstTheWorld.”</p><p><span>Other stars quickly rallied around the Grammy nominee, who’s featured on<b> Zayn Malik</b>‘s new album in a song titled “Wrong.”</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>man. just heard about kehlani. one of the nicest people ever. i wish good energy and strength for her life.</p><p>— Questlove Gomez (@questlove) <a href=#>March 29, 2016</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I support u Kehlani!!
