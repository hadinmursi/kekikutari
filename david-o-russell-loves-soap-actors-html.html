The power of soap opera actors. That actually is a nugget, and I buy it 100 percent.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f1bc03fd2e749db199b2fb0d220f29d3-5-0-0@published data-word-count=175>And he’s not wrong. Soap-opera actors shoot multiple scripts in one day, and with the decrease in budgets since the heyday of the genre (the ‘80s and ‘90s), there’s not often time for reshoots. You must know your lines, be on your mark, and be ready to shoot. There’s no time for Method acting or arguing with a director.&nbsp;It’s the sort of professional athleticism that Alfred Hitchcock greatly admired in actors. In 1962, during <a href=#>a series of interviews</a> with François Truffaut, Hitchcock famously referred to actors as cattle. For example, during the shooting of I Confess, Hitchcock didn’t get along with Montgomery Clift. According to Patricia Bosworth’s Montgomery Clift: A Biography, Hitchock would tell Clift exactly how he wanted him to behave in scenes. Clift balked at the demands and would act how he wanted in other takes, but Hitchcock would ultimately use the takes where Clift followed his instructions. It shouldn’t come as surprise that a number of the actors Hitchock worked with&nbsp;— including&nbsp;<span>Farley Granger,&nbsp;<span>John Forsythe, and&nbsp;<span>Macdonald Carey</span></span></span>&nbsp;— went on to act in soaps.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f1bc03fd2e749db199b2fb0d220f29d3-6-0-0@published data-word-count=62>Russell, who has been known to <a href=#>battle with his own actors</a> on set, is probably just embracing his inner Hitchcock. He even has Lawrence as his icy blonde. And really, is it any surprise that a director who loves <a href=#>a good screaming match</a> and casting Lawrence older than she actually is in every film would love a good Erica Kane soap-opera catfight?</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>David O.
