“Katie and Nicole have moved on from their time with Tom and are leading their own lives outside of the church,” Tony Ortega, former editor in chief of The Village Voice and a staunch critic of Scientology, says exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly.
When Kidman, 51, divorced Cruise, 56, in 2001 after nearly 11 years of marriage, their adopted children, Isabella, now 25, and Connor, 23, lived full-time with the Top Gun star and cut off practically all contact with their mom."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He and the Dawson’s Creek alum, 39, welcomed daughter Suri, now 12, before Holmes blindsided him by filing to end their six-year marriage in 2012. The actor has not been spotted with Suri since 2013, the same year that Holmes <a href=#>started quietly dating</a> <a href=#><strong>Jamie Foxx</strong></a>.</p><p>“Tom chose as wives women who are incredible mothers,” Ortega tells Us. “Katie and Nicole have spoken about raising their daughters to be independent and giving them a solid education, which is the opposite of Scientology teachings. Just living their lives is their way of moving on from the Church of Scientology.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/UW4218_cover.jpg alt="UW4128 Us Weekly Cover Nicole Kidman Katie Holmes Tom Cruise" width=1000 height=1355 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Former Scientologist turned outspoken critic <a href=#><strong>Leah Remini</strong></a> recently claimed that <a href=#>Kidman and Holmes signed agreements</a> during their respective divorces from Cruise that dictate who they talk to.
