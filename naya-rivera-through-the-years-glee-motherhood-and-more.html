She was initially hired for one episode, but her character, Donna, ended up making 11 appearances between 2002 and 2006.</p><p>The actress made her breakthrough in 2009 when she joined the cast of Glee. Initially, her cheerleader character was seen as cold-hearted and mean, but over time she became a pivotal member of the glee club at William McKinley High School. Santana came out as a lesbian during the Fox series’ third season, a particularly poignant moment for viewers in the LGBTQ community.</p><p>During her time on Glee, Rivera won a SAG Award and received a Grammy nomination, among other accolades. After the musical dramedy ended in 2015, she starred on Lifetime’s Devious Maids and YouTube Premium’s Step Up.</p><p>Throughout the years, fans became invested in the singer’s personal life and relationships. Months after her engagement to rapper <a href=#><strong>Big Sean</strong></a> ended, she married her ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Ryan Dorsey</strong></a> in July 2014. The couple welcomed a son, Josey, the following year before divorcing in June 2018.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In July 2020, Rivera was declared a missing person after going for a boat ride with Josey at Lake Piru in Ventura County, California.
