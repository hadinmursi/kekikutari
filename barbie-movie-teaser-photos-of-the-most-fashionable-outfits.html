“Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls,” a voiceover proclaimed in the first trailer, which was released in December 2022. “But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls until [Barbie].”
The YouTube footage included clips of young girls playing with baby dolls in a desert until the arrival of a tall, perfectly coiffed Barbie doll surprises them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Birds of Prey</a>&nbsp;</i>star donned a black-and-white one-piece bathing suit and white sunglasses, which pays homage to the very first Barbie doll, released in March 1959, who sported <a href=#>a similar swimwear getup</a>.</p><p class=p1>While Friday’s teaser did not reveal the plot of the <a href=#><strong>Greta Gerwig</strong></a>-directed picture, fans did see a glimpse of Robbie’s Barbie and her friends in their most stylish ensembles. <a href=#><strong>Ryan Gosling</strong></a> (Ken), <a href=#><strong>Simu Liu</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Issa Rae</strong></a> were also spotted in the video<a href=#> in doll-inspired getups</a>.</p><p class=p1><i>Barbie —&nbsp;</i>written by Gerwig and partner<a href=#> <strong>Noah Baumbach</strong></a> — has been in development since 2020. While <a href=#><strong>Amy Schumer</strong></a> was initially attached to play the doll come-to-life, Robbie later landed the gig.</p><p class=p1>“It comes with a lot of baggage!” the Australia native told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>British Vogue</a>&nbsp;</i>in June 2021 of taking on the role of the iconic doll. “And a lot of nostalgic connections. But with that come a lot of exciting ways to attack it. People generally hear ‘Barbie’ and think, ‘I know what that movie is going to be,’ and then they hear that Greta Gerwig is writing and directing it, and they’re like, ‘Oh, well, maybe I don’t.’”</p><p class=p1>Ken, the beloved boyfriend of Barbie, was <a href=#>eventually revealed to be the&nbsp;<i>La La Land&nbsp;</i>star</a> — to the delight of his real-life partner, <a href=#><strong>Eva Mendes</strong></a>.</p><p class=p1>“Eva is always supportive of the films Ryan takes on. She finds it cute and charming that he’s playing the role of Ken,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in August 2022</a> of the&nbsp;<i>Hitch&nbsp;</i>actress who <a href=#>shares two daughters with Gosling</a>. “They were actually having fun role playing together after he went blond. They both got some good laughs.”</p><p class=p1>While Robbie and Gosling began filming&nbsp;<i>Barbie&nbsp;</i>ahead of its 2023 release, photos released from set revealed that <a href=#>the Canadian hunk had died his hair blonde</a> for the role.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Well, first of all, I saw the [shirtless] photo [of Ryan in character] and the 14-year-old in me was like, ‘Ahhh,’” Mendes quipped <a href=#>during a June 2022 appearance on&nbsp;<i>The Talk</i></a>. “It’s a funny photo and he’s trying to be funny. So, it worked on all levels. … I [asked him], ‘Can I please have that underwear? Please! I never ask for anything.’ So anyway, I do have it. I’m wearing it right now.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see the best fashion moments from&nbsp;<i>Barbie&nbsp;</i>so far:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvBmqmboZViurDCyJ5krZ2RqLKzec%2Bhpq2no2K8p3nToZxmpZ%2BowW6ywKyfoqeelq%2BtsYyorK2emanAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
