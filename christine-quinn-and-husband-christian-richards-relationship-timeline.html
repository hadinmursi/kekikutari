“[My friend was] like, ‘Also, he’s looking for a house.’ And I was like: double bonus,” Quinn recalled to Bustle in May 2020. “Him and I had an amazing steak dinner and got to know each other, and we just hit it off right away. He’s everything that I ever wanted.”
She added, “He’s the opposite of me in every way because I love to put myself out there."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Their son, Christian, was born in May 2021 before they had to adapt how they kept their spark alive while parenting.</p><p class=p1>“Nighttime has really started to be, like, our me time [together],” she <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in September 2021. “During the day, it’s a little crazy. What we did is started being like, ‘OK, night is our time.’ With babies, you have to do that. You have to sleep-train them, so it’s definitely changed our daily schedule. I would say around 7:30 is when he goes to bed. He’s sleeping until 4:00, then again until 7:00.”</p><p class=p1>Quinn left <i>Selling Sunset’s </i>Oppenheim Group brokerage one year later and started her own firm with Richard.</p><p class=p1>Keep scrolling for Quinn and Richard’s complete relationship timeline:</p><h3 class=p3><b>2019</b></h3><p class=p1>After <i>Selling Sunset </i>season 1 wrapped, one of Quinn’s friends introduced the real estate agent to businessman Richard.

The process that RealOpen uses is absolutely reliable and fool-proof.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3 class=p3><b>March 2024</b></h3><p class=p1><i>Us </i>confirmed on March 20 that Richard had been<a href=#> arrested for assault</a> with a deadly weapon after allegedly throwing a bag with glass in it at Quinn.
