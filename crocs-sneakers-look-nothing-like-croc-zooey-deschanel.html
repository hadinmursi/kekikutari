What’s the first step in being comfortable in our skin? Being comfortable in our own shoes, of course! Well, at least that’s what Zooey Deschanel is claiming these days! The New Girl actress has decided to put her best foot (or feet, in this case) forward and is slipping into the most comfortable shoe known to mankind."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Being comfortable in our own shoes, of course! Well, at least that’s what <strong>Zooey Deschanel</strong> is claiming these days! The New Girl actress has decided to put her best foot (or feet, in this case) forward and is slipping into the most comfortable shoe known to mankind. Crocs!</p><p>Since joining the Crocs family as its newest ambassador, the 39-year-old wasted no time slipping into the brand’s most stylish staple. They’re not just normal Crocs, they’re cool Crocs, obviously. In fact, they’re so chic, just about everyone will be hanging up their heels and slipping into these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seriously stylish shoes</a>, ASAP!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/crocs-zooey-1.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crocs LiteRide Pacer</a> with prices starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$27</a>, available at Amazon! <i><span><strong>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, March 14th, 2019, but are subject to change</strong>. </span></i>Also available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60</a>, at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a>!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t call it a comeback because Crocs have always been here. But let’s be honest, there is nothing classic about this Croc style. No, this Zooey Deschanel-approved style is new and improved with the comfort of Crocs and the look of a slick sneaker.</p><p>The<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Crocs LiteRider Pacer</a> has a comfortable, trainer-like design which makes these our new favorite pair of kicks! In fact, this fresh pair of Crocs may kick all of our <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> to the curb. This athletic-inspired design is a spot-on doppelganger to any pair of sneakers. Striving to give users maximum comfort, this sleek sneaker was designed with Croslite which is known for its durable, all-day support and comfort.</p><p>The cushioned Croc design also features foam insoles which are super-soft, lightweight and best of all, extraordinarily resilient. Make no mistake though, just because we say they’re resilient does not mean they’re uncomfortable. The pacers are anything but! Designed with Croc’s signature Matlite, the pacer’s were built to be oh-so-smooth. For those unfamiliar with Matlite, it’s a soft, flexible material on the upper part of the shoe. More or less, it makes shoes feel broken-in from day one. As we said, smooth!</p><p>Honestly, who better to champion the ultimate girl-on-the-go style than the most relatable [new] girl, ever. Deschanel is not only a well-known and even more well-established actress, but she also happens to be juggling parenting, too! The actress and mom-of-two recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Yahoo</a> that these sneakers make multi-tasking a breeze and give her feet the support they need along with support from friends!</p><p>“I get so many compliments on them,” she told Yahoo, noting she’s a fan of other Crocs, too. “People are surprised they’re Crocs because they don’t have the normal Crocs look.”</p><p>Surely, this multi-tasking super(star) mom has little to no time to waste, making every second more valuable than the last. So she needs the support — a supporting shoe, that is!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/croc-two.jpg><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crocs LiteRide Pacer</a> with prices starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$27</a>, available at Amazon! <i>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, March 14th, 2019, but are subject to change. </i>Also available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60</a>, at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a>!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Whether a mom-on-the-go or a girl-on-the-go, Crocs are so comfortable, they’re ideal. A Croc can be worn any season or for any reason. They’re perfect and practical so it’s no wonder these perfect pacers have their own fan-base, which includes Deschanel!</p><p>From first-time wearers to long-time lovers, the pacers have checked every single box on a sneaker’s must-have list. Across the board, reviewers didn’t just like the pacers, they loved them. So many reviewers loved the plush soles, the mesh-like air holes and the athletic-inspired look. In fact, so many loved how comfortable and chic these shoes were. One reviewer actually called this plush pacer the ideal commuter shoe. The cushioned foam bed was designed to give support on even the worst of days! Even better than the reviewer who said this was the perfect commuter shoe? The reviewer who wanted to wear these shoes to just about everything. How impressive!</p><p>Wearing these daily is a breeze, too, since there are two available shades up for grabs. Between the pearl white and the black option, styling will be anything but a struggle!</p><p>For an athletic-inspired look to match the sneaker, the black option would be the best choice. Slip into a casual hoodie, black pair of workout leggings and sling a crossbody over the shoulder. In fact, this outfit would be ideal for all of those much-needed, much-hated workouts.</p><p>Transition this perfect pacer just as seamlessly into our day-to-day lives, too! The pearl white option is the ideal hue when looking for a chic, everyday staple. Due to its sleek design, it can endlessly be styled. Reach for skinny jeans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">minidresses</a>, white T-shirts and cutoff shorts. Honestly, it’s such a versatile staple it will easily replace those traditional white sneakers that are sometimes unoriginal.</p><p>Who said we had to be a new girl, to actually look like New Girl star Zooey Deschanel. Just slip into these <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">seriously stylish crocs</a> and remember to thank Us when the fans begin to swarm!</p><p><strong>See it: Grab the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crocs LiteRide Pacer</a> with prices starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$27</a>, available at Amazon! <i><span><strong>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, March 14th, 2019, but are subject to change.</strong> </span></i>Also available for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$60</a>, at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a>!
