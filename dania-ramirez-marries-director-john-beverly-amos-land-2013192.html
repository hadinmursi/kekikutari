The actress announced their engagement in January 2012. "The love of my life found me!" Ramirez told <a href=#>Latina</a> after Land's proposal. "That's how he would say it anyway since he claims he was attracted to my energy before I even turned around."</p><p>It was love at first sight for Ramirez. "The moment I turned around, he casually asked me and our mutual friend to join him for lunch and once we started talking I knew I could talk to him forever and we haven't stopped talking since!" she recalled. "And, the fact that he's ubersmart and has the most amazing son in the world, there was no doubt I was totally in.”</p><p>Land is the grandson of Aflac founder <strong>John</strong> <strong>Beverly Amos</strong>. Ramirez told <a href=#>Latina</a> she feels as though she and the filmmaker have been together in many other lifetimes. "I'm just glad we finally found each other in this one," the American Reunion actress gushed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Ramirez's other notable TV and film roles include Premium Rush, Entourage, The Sopranos and Solving Charlie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmZ6erm6%2BwKagq52qYrqivtGinKxllJ6%2Fpq%2FTqKlmop%2Bdu26uxK%2Bcq6SpYq6uu9Jmo5qmlGJ%2FcX2SanBrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
