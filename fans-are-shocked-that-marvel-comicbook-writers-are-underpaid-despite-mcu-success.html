Journalist Sam Thielman wrote, “According to multiple sources, when a writer or artist’s work features prominently in a Marvel film, the company’s practice is to send the creator an invitation to the premiere and a cheque for $5,000.”</p><p>He continued, “Three different sources confirmed this amount to the Guardian. There’s no obligation to attend the premiere, or to use the $5,000 for travel or accommodation; sources described it as a tacit acknowledgment that compensation was due.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thielman goes on to report that “several sources” claimed that the writer’s compensation can vary between “ the $5,000 payment, nothing, or – very rarely – a special character contract.” One creator who received said contract expressed that it failed to encompass the success that their work brought the Marvel franchise.</p><p>They shared, “I’ve been offered a [special character contract] that was really, really terrible, but it was that or nothing. And then instead of honoring it, they send a thank you note and are like, ‘Here’s some money we don’t owe you!’ and it’s five grand.” They added, “And you’re like, ‘The movie made a billion dollars.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The article also drew light to an incident where comicbook writers Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting made an impromptu appearance at a premiere party for Captain America: The Winter Soldier — Theilman states that although the movie was “directly based on their comics,” they were denied entrance. Eventually, Winter Soldier actor Sebastian Stan was able to let them in.</p><p>Fans were disgusted to hear about Marvel’s treatment of these writers and many began digging up past stories of mistreatment. This included the story of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket Raccoon creator Bill Mantlo</a>. Despite his character playing a pivotal role in Guardians and the Galaxy and subsequent Marvel movies, Mantlo found himself unable to afford his medical care after being involved in a hit-and-run accident.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Say This Is The Most Poorly Portrayed Character In The MCU</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan wrote, “This is literally the biggest franchise on the planet right now, @Disney should stop being greedy and properly compensate their writers and artists.”</p><p>Another tweeted, “It should be like double that at least lol. I understand these are just adaptations but if you write the story it’s based on you should get money, ESPECIALLY if you literally created the character.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>MCU Fans Think This Oscar-Winning Actor Was The Worst Casting Choice</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A third chimed in with, “Kinda just goes to show that just because a studio gives you good fan service doesn’t make them less of a corporate overlord. Good movies don’t equate good treatment of creatives behind the scene. It’s easy to see the flaws in a studio struggling than one giving you good content.”</p><p>This mistreatment of writers comes soon after the news that <a href=#>Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney</a> for breaching her Black Widow contract.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Which MCU Star Has Been Called Out By More Than One Of Their Co-Stars?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYysn6ibm5qxbsDHmqtmpZGnw6a4jJympqGTl7ywt4ywqaKslafAbq3RnmSuppSav7GtyJ1knZ2jpba1sYymmq5lo6qwpLHSrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
