The author claimed that the move was a “final blow” for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p><p>The decision for Charles to offer Frogmore to Andrew may not have meant to be a move against Harry, per Scobie, but it “undoubtedly” was. Andrew, meanwhile, repeatedly turned down the property, according to Scobie. The writer noted that Charles has a “blind spot” when it comes to his younger brother.</p><p>Andrew has lived in the family’s Royal Lodge for the past two decades, paying rent and financially contributing to the estate’s remodeling projects. In 2019, Andrew <a href=#>stepped down</a> from his duties as a working member of the royal family after he was accused of <a href=#>sexual misconduct</a>, which he vehemently denied. In May 2020, he permanently resigned from his public roles and was <a href=#>later stripped</a> of all his <a href=#>military titles</a> and patronages.</p><p>As the scandal continued to make headlines, the book claims that Charles “openly detested” his brother’s actions while also spending many nights “worrying” about him. After losing his position in the family, Andrew was no longer bringing in income and couldn’t continue to afford to maintain the lodge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Prince-Andrew-Being-Offered-Frogmore-Was-the-Final-Blow-for-Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-Book2.jpg><p>Harry and Meghan, who were living in Frogmore with son Archie, now 4 at the time, announced their plans to take a step back as senior working royals in early 2020.
