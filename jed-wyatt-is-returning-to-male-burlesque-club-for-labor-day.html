The burlesque joint’s website also noted that visitors will “enjoy a fully choreographed entertainment experience with slamming music,” adding that it’s a place where a bride can bring their “soon-to-be-mother-in-law and not have to worry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jed-Wyatt-to-Dance-in-Male-Burlesque-Show-After-Hannah-Brown-Split.jpg><p>Music City Male Revue’s hired dancers are considered to be “performers, not strippers.”</p><p>Wyatt, 25, worked at the Nashville club <a href=#>briefly in 2018</a>. Though he appeared in a few commercials and was striving to become a prominent musician, the Belmont University graduate gained recognition <a href=#>upon vying for Brown’s heart</a> on <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brown, 24, chose the season 15 contender in the show’s two-part finale. However, the former pageant queen <a href=#>ended their relationship</a> after <a href=#>learning about Wyatt having a girlfriend</a>, fellow singer <strong>Haley Stevens</strong>, waiting for him back home.</p><p>During his appearance on the “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast, Wyatt maintained that he was “not in an exclusive relationship” with Stevens.</p><p>“If you really do love someone, no matter how promising they’ve made it seem, if they’re going on a dating show, regardless of why they’re going on a dating show, why would you stay with them? If I was in a relationship, I would not have gone onto a dating show,” he said on August 2. “That’s just me. I’m not a cheater. And with my time with Haley, I did hang out with other people. I did date other people. I slept with other people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZRixLqt061koqtdp7K1wdGnoKefXam8brnApZxmmqWnuaa%2F0K6cZpucqq9uss6rZKWZkqS%2FbrDAsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
