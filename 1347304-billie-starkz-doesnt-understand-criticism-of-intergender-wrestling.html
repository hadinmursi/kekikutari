Starkz feels like wrestling men has helped her grow as a performer and doesn’t understand the hatred some people have for it.</p><p>“I’ve always looked at it as it’s another wrestler versus another wrestler, not as male and female. I feel like so many people make that line, and I don’t understand it. I’ve always enjoyed it as a wrestler because I’m like, ‘Oh, I get new talent to wrestle.’ There’s so many more guys in wrestling than females, and this gives me access to so many more opponents and so many matches.</p><p>”I don’t understand why people try to divide men and women. At the end of the day, we’re all competitors. We’re all trained the same way. Why can’t we compete together? I also don’t understand the hate towards it. I truly, as a person, I don’t understand why people have so much hatred towards it.”</p><p>Billie Starkz said she has heard people try and argue that it’s reminiscent of domestic abuse, but doesn’t believe that’s a valid argument.</p><p>“If we’re saying that, why are you watching wrestling? What about a lesbian relationship, and there’s two females fighting? That could also be considered domestic abuse. Then there’s males and males fighting each other. That’s domestic abuse. If this is something that triggers you, please just stay away from it. I completely understand that. But at the end of the day, you have to let people do these things so we can grow as wrestlers.</p><p>“I have honestly learned so much [from] being in the ring with guys, and I’ve learned so much being in the ring with women. But if I had the divide of, ‘Oh, I can’t wrestle these guys at all,’ I don’t think I would have improved so quickly in wrestling if I didn’t have those matches.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJtbmxoZGKvqrjLopxmq6SWv6zGjJ2mnqueqXq2usOeqayskaOxbq%2FRoquim5moum67xWagp6yVp7SmusOeqWavoprAtbjIp54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
