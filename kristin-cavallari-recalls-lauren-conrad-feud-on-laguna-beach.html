We know how reality TV works, so it would be totally different now. But I think, to your point, that’s what made it what it was.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kristin-Cavallari-Recalls-Laguna-Beach-Editing-That-Pitted-Her-Against-LC-001.jpg><p>Cavallari and the LC Lauren Conrad designer were at odds for two seasons, which aired on MTV from 2004 to 2005, in large part due to <a href=#>their love triangle</a> with <a href=#><strong>Stephen Colletti</strong></a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Conrad now <a href=#>shares sons</a> Liam, 3, and Charlie, 12 months, with husband <a href=#><strong>William Tell</strong></a>, while the True Comfort author and estranged husband <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> — they <a href=#>announced their separation</a> in April — are <a href=#>parents</a> of son Camden, 8, son Jaxon, 6, and daughter Saylor, 4.</p><p>The Uncommon James designer clarified earlier this month that <a href=#>her friction with Conrad</a> is a thing of the past. “[We’re] totally fine,” she said during the Monday, October 19, episode of Bleav Podcast Network’s “On the List” podcast. “I think so much time has passed and what we went through was so silly and it was so high school, I’m pretty sure we’re both over it at this point!”</p><p>Cavallari, Conrad, Colletti, Sinclair, <strong>Trey Phillips</strong>, <strong>Dieter Schmitz</strong>, <strong>Loren Polster</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Lo Bosworth</strong></a>, <strong>Talan Torriero</strong> and <strong>Morgan Smith</strong> <a href=#>reunited via Zoom to promote voting</a> in the 2020 election.
