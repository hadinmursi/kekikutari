The Challenge: All Stars is filled with reality stars who made their debut on The Real World and Road Rules — and who are ready to show they’ve still got what it takes.
“My fear is being stuck in the middle of something and not having a way out,” Delgado, now 40, told the Tampa Bay Times in 2005 after she was sent home from Road Rules for refusing to scale a mountain."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You might not understand my fear. But I didn’t physically think that I could do it.”</p><p>A lot has changed since then — including Delgado’s thoughts on reality TV. Before heading on her last season of The Challenge in 2005, she shared that she wasn’t sure it was the right move for her.</p><p>“I don’t regret doing the show. But maybe all the feelings I went through weren’t something I should have gone through in front of the whole world,” she said at the time, while planning to go to college for a degree in business. “I don’t think reality TV is a good <a href=#>stepping-stone into the entertainment industry</a> [because] you’re seeing what people are really about. You may think <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a> is a nice person, but who knows what she’s like if she gets woken up at 12 in the morning?”</p><p>Needless to say, <a href=#>she’s back and better than ever</a> — so much so that the show’s executive producer and star <a href=#><strong>Mark Long</strong></a> said <a href=#>she’s one to watch</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She’ll admit it: She’s not the most physically fit girl in the room, but her heart is bigger than anyone’s. The quit in her is not there, and she’s so funny,” the two-time champion, 49, said on <a href=#>the “Watch With Us: Challenge Edition” podcast</a>. “She’s a fiery Latina. I think she’s going to be a fan favorite.”</p><p>Ahead of the premiere, Delgado shared a message to her fans. “What an extraordinary adventure my life has really turned out to be. I had the distinguished honor to play alongside of some of the best,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on March 16. “I am so grateful to my friend @themarklong for making this happen for all of us. To the people whom have watched over the years and stuck by my side, this is for you!”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to get to know more about the MTV star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6q%2FxKWYZpyVobSisM5mnp6sXam8brfNqK5mrJiaeqS0wKWjnqaXmnqiuMtmqq2Zoqh6pLvNrZysrJGjwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
