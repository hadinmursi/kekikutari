She was born on 22nd July 1979 in the Ojota area of Lagos, Nigeria, but originally hails from Okpella in Benin, Edo State.

She got married to Daniel Ademinokan, a Nollywood movie director and producer. The duo met on a movie set, began dating, and got married after a while.</p><p>Details of when they actually met and their wedding ceremony are not public knowledge, but they called their marriage quit in 2010.</p><p>Before it crashed, the union produced a son, David Ademinokan, born on 4th April 2008. David is currently 14 years old. Her ex-husband got their child’s custody, and the baby lives in the united states with his dad. In 2018, Doris visited her son in the US, and the mother and son were seen having a good time.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-led-to-their-divorce></span><strong>What Led to Their Divorce?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Different sources have different stories as to what led to the end of actress Doris and Daniel’s marriage. While there are stories that Daniel accused her of infidelity, other stories have it that Doris left because he was abusive. After all, a different source related their reason for separating to “irreconcilable differences.”</p><p>In any way, Doris Simeon has long moved on with her life and career. She recently spoke about the kind of relationship she has with her ex-husband and baby daddy. According to her, she still sees Daniel as a good friend she met years ago and as the father of her son. She also added that she wishes him well in all his endeavors.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=criticisms-that-followed-daniel-ademinokans-remarriage-to-stella-damasus></span><strong>Criticisms That Followed Daniel Ademinokan’s Remarriage to Stella Damasus</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Meanwhile, Daniel Ademinokan had run into the warm hands of another Nollywood actress Stella Damasus on the heels of his marriage travail with Doris. The two didn’t hesitate to tie the knot in 2011, just the following year after he divorced Doris. The marriage generated a lot of controversies and dragging as many people called Stella a husband snatcher.</p><p>However, actress Stella publicly defended herself in a long paged post where she explained exactly what she understands by the word “snatch.” She ended up by saying that there was no way she could have snatched a full-grown man from anybody. Following their wedding, Daniel and Stella went on “terrorizing” Doris with their public display of affection on Instagram.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-marriage-has-also-hit-the-rocks></span><strong>The Marriage Has Also Hit the Rocks</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>However, the union has since 2020 crashed irretrievably. This is Stella’s third time attempting marriage and Daniel’s second time walking out of marriage. The once lovey-dovey couple had also publicly engaged in a war of words, throwing shades at each other.</p><p>On the other hand, actress Doris’ fans have rejoiced on her behalf, saying that God is fighting her battles as Karma came really quick for the two. Below are a few reactions from social media users after the news of their separation broke on the internet.</p><p>“Karma came quick for this one. I bet Doris is in one corner sipping her burukutu on them”</p><p>“You see ehn… Karma no dey miss house address! E go they serve them there as e dey hot”</p><p>“So this Marriage don scatter?? After stealing him”</p><p>“God of Doris is still alive”</p><p>“Karma na your mate”</p><p>Meanwhile, Stella and Doris never had any public altercation, so we do not know the relationship they share. Doris Simeon has since not married anyone and is not known to be in any relationship. The mother of one seems to be currently prioritizing her career over a relationship as she barely talks about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ydpquho2LAqrnEqKVmr5iWwW610mafnqpdlrSmecCnm2acn5rAbr%2FHnmShmaaaeqJ5zZ6uZqClqK%2BiusNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
