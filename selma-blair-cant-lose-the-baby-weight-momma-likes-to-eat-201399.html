The 41-year-old actress and mother of 2-year-old son Arthur tells <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> that she still hasn't been able to lose the baby weight due to her love of food. While attending the Christian Siriano Spring 2014 fashion show at Eyebeam Atelier in New York City on Saturday, Sept. 7, Blair confessed to the magazine that she had just enjoyed a very big meal before the show.</p><p>"This is why I can't lose my baby weight, because I ate crepes, I ate French toast, I ate an ice cream cone, I had french fries, and three hamburgers!" she said. "Then I'm going to go and have a full dinner with my son. Then I'll go out again tonight."</p><p>Blair says her problem is that she's "really always hungry" and she wishes she could curb her appetite. "It's terrible and I don't like what it does to my body, believe me, because I'm not one of these people that's like, I can eat whatever I want, whenever," Blair explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But the former Anger Management actress has found a way to hide any extra pounds she may be carrying. She added, "I'm like, no, I need a tight leather dress to keep all those hamburgers in, and I got one!"</p><p>At NYC Fashion Week back in 2011 — shortly after Arthur's birth — Blair also talked with <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>about her very <a href=#>similar post-baby weight loss</a> woes. "I actually haven't lost any weight since the day I left the hospital," the star told to Us at the J. Mendel fashion show. "I still weigh the exact same number. I haven't really been focusing on that at all, because I've been running around to different things like Toronto [International Film Festival] and Venice [Film Festival].</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasnZyirm6uy5qgq2WTlru1ecuoqp5lpJ2ybq7Am7Bmr5WetKnAjKampqWRYrmqt8SsZK2nXZqutXmRaWhscWlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
