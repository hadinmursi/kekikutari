Decades later, it would be revealed that during his time as assistant coach, more than 50 members of the wrestling team were sexually assaulted by the team’s doctor, Richard Strauss. The major question is what, if anything, Jim Jordan knew of the assaults. Jordan has repeatedly denied knowing about the assaults, however several anonymous former wrestlers and one referrer have told police that they’d made Jordan aware of the situation. Wrestlers who did not complain directly to Jordan claim that he had to have known that wrestlers were being assaulted and that it was an open secret among the team.</p><h2 id=personal-life><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span><strong>Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jim Jordan and his wife, Polly, live near Urbana in central Champaign County in Ohio.
