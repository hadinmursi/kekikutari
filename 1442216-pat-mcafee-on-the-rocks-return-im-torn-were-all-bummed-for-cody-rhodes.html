Seemingly gonna have to wait at least another few months while The Rock, the biggest star in the world, the biggest star on planet Earth, will be taking on his cousin Roman Reigns for the Head of the Table conversation that has been chatted about forever. Now, I love Cody Rhodes. I love The Rock, and just love Roman Reigns. So I’m very torn on this entire thing, but the Internet was not happy.”</p><h2 id=h-pat-mcafee-i-don-t-know-what-s-going-to-happen>Pat McAfee: I Don’t Know What’s Going To Happen</h2><p>Pat McAfee went on to note that he was bummed out, and he does know what’s going to happen moving forward.</p><p>&nbsp;“I’m bummed out,” Pat McAfee said. “I still don’t know what’s all going to take place between now and WrestleMania. Obviously, there’s an [event] on Thursday at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, there’s Monday Night RAW tonight. But we’re all pretty bummed out for Cody, but also very pumped if this is a Rock-Roman situation.</p><p>“I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t know what’s going to happen. Obviously, in WWE, you can never know what’s going to take place. But certainly for people pissed off on a Friday.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of WWE RAW as it airs on Monday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtaWtpZmK9osCMppqanpWaerC6jK2fnmWipLCsv4yrnK2toqN6qrmMraarpl2ssrOxjJqjpWWSqrquscNmnaiqXZi8pcWMq5%2BonJWo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
