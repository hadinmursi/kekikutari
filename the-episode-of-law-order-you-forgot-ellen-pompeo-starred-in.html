In the episode titled <a href=#>"Savior,"</a> Pompeo plays a teenage girl, Jenna Weber who survives a home invasion that leaves her mother and brother dead. Her alcoholic father, Ron Weber, is suspected of the murders. Ron has been having money troubles and has recently lost his job. This prompts Dr. Elizabeth Olivet to profile Ron as a <a href=#>"family annihilator"</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who believes they have to kill their family in order to protect them from their personal failures.</p><p dir=ltr>Jenna testifies that there is no way her father could have committed this crime. Ron swears he didn't do this because he was blackout drunk at a bar. Not the best alibi, but okay. Eventually, it comes to light that Jenna and her mother were constantly at odds with each other. Their rocky relationship was due to Jenna's mother, not wanting her to see her degenerate boyfriend Chester. The dots are connected and E.A.D.A Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) gets Ron to pretend to take a deal that would put him in jail for 30 years. Not wanting this for her father, Jenna breaks down, confessing that she hired Chester to murder her mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kGlqampjZ3y1tMRmnKmho6SxpnnOn2SlmadivLOwxKtksqelYrOwvsaoq2adnKGyr3nPqKSpnZ9iwLWt0aucnWWZo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
