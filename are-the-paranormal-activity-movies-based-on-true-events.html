Created by Oren Peli, the franchise’s first film premiered in 2007 and was released worldwide in 2009.
The movies are commonly based around families haunted by the demon Asmodeus “Tobi” of the Book of Tobit. The demon stalks, scares, and ultimately kills several family members.
Paranormal Activity movies use production cameras set up, used security cameras, and other recording devices in an attempt to show the films as found footage."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the origin of the film series was rooted in something very familiar.</p><p>The director and writer of the original movie, Peli, has spoken about the uncanny real-life influences of that first title.</p><p>In a 2009 interview with&nbsp;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, he talked about living in San Diego (the same as the couple in the first movie), sharing it was his experiences in the home that made him make the film.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>He said he had&nbsp;never lived in a single detached family home which made him hyper-aware of every tiny noise he heard at night.</p><p>From the house settling to things moving on the shelf, the director was terrified enough to set up a video camera to document the mysterious noises at night.</p><p>Thus, the premise for the original Paranormal Activity film was born.</p><p>And even though the series isn’t based on real events, the scares seem creepily true. Not to mention, Asmodeus is based on a real-life demon, adding more scare to the franchise.</p><p>Most of the series revolves around the demon, a malevolent entity that spent over two decades haunting the descendants of a witch who agreed to give her family’s firstborn son in exchange for power.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>The film presents as found footage, which has been super successful for a long time because of how realistic it is.</p><p>People may also find it realistic in its depiction of how people usually come to believe their resident is haunted.</p><p>For much of the film, the families featured in the movie experience mostly minor household disturbances like doors opening on their own, lights turning on or off, and pictures falling off the wall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-3-2011></span>Paranormal Activity 3 (2011)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paranormal Activity 3 comes first in all Paranormal Activity movies in order. The mystery over the origin of the demon Tobi remained during the first two films.</p><p>But it was fully revealed in the third installment, primarily set in 1988.</p><p>It follows young sisters Katie and Kristi, who are exhibiting strange behavior, leading their mom, Julie, and her boyfriend, Dennis, to set up cameras around their home.</p><p>Kristi is then shown having an imaginary friend, Tobi, who might be far more real beyond anyone’s anticipation.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>The prequel is perhaps best known for fully introducing The Midwives Coven, who continues to play major roles in the film series.</p><p>Paranormal Activity 3 ends with Julie and Dennis being killed at her mom Lois’ farm, where a group of women is seen engaged in a ritual. The runes from the sister’s room appear on the wall of Lois’ home.</p><p>The movie may prompt many to wonder how much video footage one family can possibly shoot. Yet, this film attained mostly positive reviews.</p><p>Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the third film is not connected with real-life stories in any way, but its realistic found footage genre may convince some to believe it is real.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-2-2010></span>Paranormal Activity 2 (2010)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paranormal Activity 2 takes place a month before the events of the original film. It formally introduces viewers to Katie’s sibling Kristi and her husband Daniel.</p><p>It is set in August 2006, when Kristi and Daniel had recently welcomed a baby boy named Hunter, the first male born on her family’s side since the 1930s.</p><p>Hunter’s arrival invites sinister spirits into the family, which eventually possess Kristi. Here we learn, it was actually Daniel responsible for Katie being tormented in the first movie released in 2009.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Fearing for the life of his lovable wife, son, and daughter, he transfers the demon to Katie’s home by burning a photo of the new host (a blood relative) and placing it inside the person’s home.</p><p>In the end, the film catches up to the events of the first movie, picking up where it left off in the final act.</p><p>Katie kills her husband, Micah, snaps Daniel’s neck, and takes baby Hunter away -once again disappearing into the night. The demon finally collected on the deal it made decades earlier.</p><p>Similar to Paranormal 3, the second installment also has no connection with true events.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-2009></span>Paranormal Activity (2009)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paranormal Activity is set in October 2006 and it’s where the series started. It follows Katie and Micah who have recently moved to a new house in San Diego.</p><p>The pair are soon terrorized by a demon that has followed Katie since childhood. Wanting to learn what exactly is going on, Micah set up the video cameras around their house.</p><p>A demonic entity eventually presents itself and possesses Katie. The movie ends with Katie killing her partner and vanishing in the dark.</p><p>The creative spark that started the franchise did start in the real world but in a decidedly less haunted approach than the audience might imagine as director Peli was inspired by his own experience.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>He told that the whole thing began with some empirically normal activities when the filmmaker moved to a new house in San Diego and started hearing noises at night.</p><p>His first instinct wasn’t that the place was haunted, but the events did get him to think about what was happening.</p><p>It led me to the idea of what if someone did think their house was haunted and wanted to prove or disprove it, so they set up a video camera,” he said to&nbsp;Guerilla Film Makers Pocketbook.</p><p>To reiterate, Paranormal Activity is now based on a real-life story.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-4-2012></span>Paranormal Activity 4 (2012)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Set in November 2011, Paranormal Activity 4 centers on Alex Nelson and her family in a neighborhood in Henderson, Nevada.</p><p>The family starts to experience hauntings, concerning Nelson’s adopted brother, Wyatt (Hunter from Paranormal 2), after Katie and her son, Robbie, come to live across the street.</p><p>The situation gets worse when Robbie comes to stay with Alex’s family when his mother is in the hospital. Alex’s boyfriend, Ben, helps her to film the activity via MacBook, an iPhone camera, and Kinect technology.</p><p>Robbie also has an imaginary friend named Tobi -a familiar name to those who have watched the earlier movies. While staying at the Nelsons, he introduces Wyatt to Tobi.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>With Alex and her dad, Doug, out to dinner one night, Katie returns to the house. Alex’s mom, Holly, is killed after being slammed against the ceiling by an unseen force. When Ben arrives, Katie snaps his neck.</p><p>Returning home, the father and daughter see Katie leading Wyatt to her house, prompting Doug to follow them.</p><p>Soon, Alex finds Ben’s body in her house and runs across the street to find her father, only to see him being dragged away and killed. She continues to search for her little brother, Wyatt.</p><p>Escaping through a window, she finds her brother with many women donning the triangle around their necks. As she turns to run, she is knocked over by demonic Katie and the footage cuts out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-the-marked-ones-2014></span>Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones (2014)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones is set in June 2012, continuing the signature found-footage style. The fourth film offers some Latino flare for the dramatics.</p><p>The film showcases a Latino community in Oxnard, California, where some high school graduates deal with a mysterious cult’s demon, which has marked one of them.</p><p>A young Latino, Jesse, is partying with his girlfriend and friends at an apartment. And when a mysterious murder takes place in the apartment, the partygoers try to investigate the crime scene.</p><p>The true horror of this film starts when Jesse notices a bite mark on his arm -meaning he’s become marked by the Midwives.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>And unless a final ritual is completed, the young boy will be a part of the witch’s army of possessed men.</p><p>In an attempt to find out what is happening to them, Jesse and his friends document their experience via basic tools of video recording and take clues from the previous film.</p><p>The film, featuring a family in a suburban neighborhood, brings some Latin realness in with a real story of possession. It includes more humor and visual effects compared to previous films, reports&nbsp;LA Times.</p><p>Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones implies this is no longer just the story of Katie and her family’s history with a demon nicknamed Tobi.</p><p>It shows that Katie and her sister’s story is just a small part of a larger campaign of demonic conquest, spearheaded by a coven of evil witches.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-the-ghost-dimension-2015></span>Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension is set in December 2013. It isn’t a true story, but the scares seem realistic.</p><p>It is the first installment not to star Katie but is referred to often. Most of the movie features the young 1988 Katie from the third installment.</p><p>If you ever wondered where Tobi comes from, the sixth installment is where you get the answer. It follows a new family -father Ryan, mother Emily, their young daughter Leila, uncle Mike, and friend Skylar.</p><p>They move into a new house and find a video camera and tapes in the garage. And it isn’t long after their daughter starts talking to her new imaginary friend.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>When they go through the camera lens, they begin experiencing paranormal activities, including the re-emergence of young Katie and Kristi. It turns out their home is haunted in a lot more ways.</p><p>During the finale of the movie, Leila’s parents invite an exorcist in an attempt to exorcise Tobt from their house, but moments later, Skylar kills Mike and soon kills himself.</p><p>Ryan is shortly killed after being skewered by a demon arm. The young girl hides in her room, where a portal allows her and Emily to enter the Ghost Dimension, where a young Katie greets them.</p><p>Leila then offers her blood and summons Toby. Her mom pleads with the now-human demon to release her child and gets her neck broken, leading to the creepy final shot of the film.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=paranormal-activity-next-of-kin-2021></span>Paranormal Activity: Next Of Kin (2021)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paranormal Activity: Next to Kin introduces the demon&nbsp;Asmodeus, based on real-life Christian mythology and lore.</p><p>In the seventh installment, viewers are introduced to a story separate from what came earlier, leaving behind the story set up by the Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension ending.</p><p>The film follows Margot, a woman abandoned by her mom, Sarah, at birth. She is making a documentary about her journey to find her origin after her cousin finds her through an ancestry app.</p><p>Her journey leads her to an Amish world that protects the world from an ancient demon, Asmodeus, that would threaten the entire living if he escaped.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>This community was tasked with remaining vigilant and making sacrifices to keep the demon from annihilating humanity.</p><p>Margot’s family is ritualistically spellbound by the witch to contain the essence of Asmodeus in their bodies. Later, Margot finds her mother in the hellish cavern below the town’s church.</p><p>In the final scene, her cameraman Chris and sound guy Dale take on the brave task to save the doomed girl. The cameraman goes down into the cavern and stops the witch’s preparation of Margot’s body.</p><p>He brakes the magic seal that keeps the demon (in Sarah’s body) at bay. The kids successfully escape the cave alive but so does Asmodeus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmimnq1tMRmp5qqkaO8s7nApWSam6Sew6rA2GakqK6ZmsBursCsnJ1ln6N6tb7UnmSerpWjwbR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
