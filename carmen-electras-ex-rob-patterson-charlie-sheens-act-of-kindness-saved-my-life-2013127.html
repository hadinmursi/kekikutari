The book, which Patterson is busy writing right now, details his life with Electra ("filled with passion"), his avid drug use, and his experience on Sheen’s My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not an Option tour.</p><p>"During my time living with Carmen, I used heroin habitually," the former Korn rocker writes. "Mostly I would sneak off and get high… To this day I don't know to the extent she knew I was shooting dope. It's not as if I was fooling her. Sometimes she would look at me and say, 'I hate seeing you so sad.' That's how she perceived my addiction, as sad, which it truly was."</p><p>The guitarist, who split from his fiancee, describes his heroin addiction in the book, noting "I was a bloody, f—king mess, shaking profusely."</p><p>But an unlikely friend helped him clean up his act. "On September 16, 2011, I checked into the Hills Treatment Center…. I paid cash and as collateral, I gave Dr. Samuels a Rolex watch that Charlie had bought me. When I finished rehab, Dr. Samuels handed me back the watch. 'You earned it,' he said. Charlie's act of kindness saved my life."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source close to Patterson says, "Charlie is still one of Rob's best friends."</p><p>The book does not yet have an official release date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqaqp2au26xy56araqRqHqmxIyrpptloJbBtbHRrKanZZOdrrO4yJ5krKCVmru0ecCcq2anlmK4qrrDp5ysq12orrexw2aksmWcnrOmeZFpaGxpYmx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
