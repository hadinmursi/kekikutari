In 2017, NJPW star Katsuyori Shibata suffered a subdural hematoma which seemingly forced him to retire. He made his return to the ring in 2021 and started wrestling more frequently with ROH/AEW in 2022. Shibata became a featured member of the ROH roster and won the ROH Pure Championship, but he has not wrestled for NJPW since January 2022."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(H/t Jeremy Lambert of <a href=#>Fightful </a>for the translation)</p><p>“I can’t work as an affiliated fighter,” Shibata said. “I guess that (New Japan’s decision) is not wrong. But if there is no place for me, then there is no reason for me to be here. I’ve regained a lot of my senses after competing in AEW, and I feel like I want to finish my career here.”</p><p>Shibata also commented on his health, saying, “I’ve been checked by a doctor, and I’ve given him a medical certificate. If I don’t clear it, I can’t compete.”</p><p>Shibata was reportedly forced to take some time away from AEW/ROH, as he had to return to Japan. More information is available <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>In December, AEW <a href=#>officially announced</a> that Shibata signed with the company. It is not known when he will return to AEW programming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsbGpxZ2K4osDSrrCoqpliwKm1wZqrmmWjlsa0eceeZLCZnqnAbsDOZp2ippmotW60yKxknJmimrKzedaiq6FlkZrE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
