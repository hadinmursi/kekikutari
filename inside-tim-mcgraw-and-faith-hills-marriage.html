To have come this far makes them both so grateful.”</p><p>That’s because they’ve been <a href=#>building their relationship</a> for 24 years, during which time they’ve had three daughters — Gracie, 23, Maggie, 21, and Audrey, 18 — whom they raised in Tennessee, won Grammys, embarked on three Soul2Soul tours, and released their joint album, “The Rest of Our Life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Inside-Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill-Marriage-01.jpg><p>Maggie, who’s witnessed their love firsthand, reveals that her parents’ personalities and ethics mesh well together: “They’re both super hardworking and super intelligent,” the Stanford University student, who <a href=#>helped organize last month’s Feed the Front Line Live presented by CMT</a>, tells Us. “They’re not afraid to speak their opinions and speak their minds.”</p><p>But even the best of marriages have their lows. In the beginning, McGraw, now 53, and Hill, now 52, didn’t experience that newly wedded bliss so many just-married couples feel. “Tim and Faith hadn’t been together that long when they got married,” says another insider. The songstress was already three months pregnant with Gracie, adds the insider, “so they still had a lot to learn about each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Inside-Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill-Marriage-02.jpg><p>The “Live Like You Were Dying” singer’s issues with alcohol only compounded things, but <a href=#>quit drinking</a> after Hill issued an ultimatum and threatened to end their marriage.</p><p>“Tim sobered up pretty quickly,” says the first source. “It took incredible willpower and determination for him to do that like he did. Faith’s so proud of him for stepping up to the plate and saving his family.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Now with that road bump way behind them, McGraw and Hill are “in a good place — better then they’ve ever been,” says the source. “They’ve come full circle. They’d marry each other all over again.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Inside-Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill-Marriage-03.jpg alt="Us Weekly Cover Issue 2520 Inside Tim McGraw Faith Hill Marriage" width=1000 height=1355 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>For more on McGraw and Hill’s solid romance of more than two decades watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ506KkZqWTnL%2Biw4yapZ1llpa2tbSMoaClpKNiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
