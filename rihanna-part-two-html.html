And now, as you might expect, they’re doing their best to stretch the story out for as long as possible. Yesterday, we <a href=#>got the first taste of Sawyer’s interview on Good Morning America</a>, the main takeaway of which was Rihanna’s plea for other victims of domestic abuse to “Eff love.” And this morning, ABC released <a href=#>another teaser</a> for tonight’s big Rihanna 20/20 special, one in which she begins to describe some of the events of that tragic evening. She admits that she became upset with Brown when he received a booty text from a third party and, when she refused to drop the subject, he turned violent. “He had no soul in his eyes,” she tells Diane Sawyer. “Just blank … He was clearly blacked out. There was no person when I looked at him.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-9257279b2ba54815abc9e60fd977c1cf-4-0-0@published data-word-count=10><a href=#>Rihanna Exclusive: ‘He Had No Soul in His Eyes’</a> [ABC]</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Rihanna, Part Two: Chris Brown ‘Had No Soul in His Eyes’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlncmdhZnyztceapaeZj6Wus8C%2Bra6oZpipuq0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
