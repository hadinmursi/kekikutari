The former Miss Teen USA runner-up also reports on the sidelines for the Detroit Tigers and the Detroit Red Wings.</p><p>The power forward has had his fair share of high-profile relationships over the years, including a brief <a href=#>fling with <strong>Madison Beer</strong> </a>and a year-long relationship Jenner, 24. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and Griffin first started hooking up in September 2017, shortly after the NBA player<a href=#> ended his engagement</a> to <strong>Brynn Cameron</strong>, with whom he shares two children. A source close to Jenner told Us one month later that the duo had established themselves as a “full-on couple.”</p><p>Though the reality star has been known to keep her romantic life relatively private, she was often seen cheering Griffin on from the sidelines of his games. Jenner only spoke publicly of her relationship with the NBA star once, telling Vogue in March 2018 that she had “someone being very nice” to her.</p><p>The pair cooled off shortly after the model’s revelation, less than one year after making their romance official. Jenner moved on with Philadelphia 76ers player <a href=#><strong>Ben Simmons</strong></a> that summer, but the pair called it quits in May 2019.</p><p>Before their split, 76ers co-owner <strong>Michael Rubin</strong> told Business Insider that <a href=#>the model was a “great influence”</a> on the 23-year-old small forward.</p><p>“I think Kendall’s awesome,” Rubin said in December 2018. “I’ve spent a bunch of time with her. I was with Kendall a few days ago, and Kendall insisted on going home and getting a good night’s sleep when Ben wanted to stay out for a late dinner.”</p><p>The exes sparked reunion rumors after they were spotted <a href=#>ringing in the new year together</a> at a rooftop party in downtown Philadelphia. One week earlier, Jenner was seen watching from a box seat as her ex and the 76ers take on the New Orleans Pelicans.</p><p>Despite her tendency to keep her love life under wraps, the reality star <a href=#>clapped back</a> at a viral meme that criticized her for dating several notable basketball stars.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This is a playoff team lmao,” a Twitter user wrote alongside a photo of Griffin, Simmons, <strong>Jordan Clarkson</strong>,<strong> D’Angelo Russell</strong> and <strong>Kyle Kuzma</strong> in July 2019.</p><p>Jenner took the joke in stride, responding, “2 out of 5 accurate, thanks.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZ6Zrq24jKOcp6aVp8BusddmmaWZm5p6qL7In52ipl2ewG6wwK2gp59dl7%2Bwu8qeZJ%2BklamwqbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
