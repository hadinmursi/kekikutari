Having been <a href=#>arrested by an Atlanta police officer</a> just two weeks earlier, the Oscar-winning star seemed to be sending the message that she had patched things up with the department. However, a representative for the APD tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that the cap in question did not come from them.</p><p>"We did not send her that hat," Senior Officer Stanionis from the Public Affairs Unit tells <strong>Us</strong>. "I do not know where the hat came from. It looks like someone just took one of our patches — I'm not sure where she got one — and sewed or glued it onto a black hat."</p><p>A second source confirms that Witherspoon got the hat on her own. And though it isn't real, her remorse over the situation is. "She has reached out to the Atlanta PD a few times, and she personally apologized to the officer who she interacted with," the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, the Mud actress <a href=#>said last week</a> that she had tried to make amends with the department. Speaking about the incident on Good Morning America on Thursday, May 2, she explained that she "panicked" when she saw her husband, CAA agent <strong>Jim Toth</strong>, being arrested for driving under the influence.</p><p>"I was so disrespectful," she admitted. "I have police officers in my family. I work with police officers every day. I know better. It's just unacceptable."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Yesterday I spoke to [the authorities] again and just said, 'There is no reason to be disrespectful to a police officer,'" she added. "Again, I just panicked."</p><p><a href=#>Video footage</a> of the actress' Apr. 19 run-in with the law shows her inebriated and arguing with the arresting officer over the charges. "My name is Reese Witherspoon. You're arresting me for obstruction of justice. It's gonna be in the national news — I just want to let you know," she says in one clip. "I wanted to talk to you like a normal person would talk to a normal person. You told me not to get out of the car and I said to you, 'I disagree.' Because that's my right as an American."</p><p>Last week, on May 2, the 37-year-old star <a href=#>pled no contest</a> to the disorderly conduct charge that had been leveled against her. Per TMZ, she'll pay just a $213 fine for her infraction. Toth, meanwhile, pled guilty to DUI and was sentenced to 40 hours of community service. Additionally, he must attend an alcohol education program and will be on probation for 12 months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarnZWosm7DyK2fnqqjpbywutJmmK2kkaPBonnPqKOim5Visaa8wKurpp2eqXqprdNmoKxllpa4pnnOn52im5WnerSt2Kxka2hhaIN2ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
