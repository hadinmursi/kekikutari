"It's a lot of butt. I got scared," the actor admits in an interview with New York Magazine's <a href=#>Vulture</a>. "Unless I'm around certain people, I don't like to be naked."</p><p>The 25-year-old wasn't given any warning before he was asked to disrobe on the small screen (including one torrid sex scene with a female costar in the Oct. 17 season premiere). "You pretty much get the script and find out that way," explains the actor, who's <a href=#>dating his Adult World costar</a> <a href=#><strong>Emma Roberts</strong></a>.</p><p>If Peters' frequent nudity has made things awkward on set, he hasn't noticed. "I have a great picture of me naked on a bed just wearing a c-ck sock, and the crew is all around me, bored. We were all waiting for a film roll or a lens to arrive. So I'm just sitting around naked on the bed and everyone's so nonchalant," he recalls. "It was really weird for me, like, 'Man, this is awkward.'"</p><p>Unlike <strong>Dylan McDermott</strong>, who frequently appeared nude during the show's first season, Peters says he isn't in tip-top shape. "He's smart," Peters says of his buff former costar, 50. "He had them bring him a gym on set. They hooked him up with a bench-press machine and all these free weights so he could work out in between takes. That dude was naked the whole time. I'd like to [ask for] that, but I'm not Dylan McDermott, so I can't be like, 'Give me a bunch of free weights,' you know?"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>American Horror Story: Asylum airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. EST on FX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyvmZ5ivabAxKuqZquYpLy1tc2gZJqllae2pK3NZp%2BoqqKkv26%2F06ipsmWeqrGmedKcnKedo2LApK3RnptmpZVif3F9kWtramhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
