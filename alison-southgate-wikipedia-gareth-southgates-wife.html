Couple has been married for more than 20 years now. He was a trainee at Crystal Palace and she was working as a store assistant when they met and quickly became each other interests. Alison has been sighted in the Wembley stands cheering for the squad, despite the fact that she is not a huge football fan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alison-southgat-married-gareth-southgate-in-1997></span>Alison Southgat married Gareth Southgate in 1997<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In July 1997, Alison Southgate married Alison Bird at St Nicholas’s Church in Worth; the couple have two children. Family have resided in the spa town of Harrogate, North Yorkshire since the early 2000s, owning many homes in and around the town, including a grand Victorian townhouse on the Duchy Estate, before settling in a £3.75 million country house 8 miles from the town centre.</p><p>Gareth has long used his personal experience to inform his ‘family first’ approach with the squad, and he has been upfront about the fact that spending time with his wife and two children helps him stay sane when he’s not on the field. Alison Southgat is more likely to be offering a low-key support from afar during this year’s World Cup tournament.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alison-southgates-height></span>Alison Southgate’s height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>How tall is Alison Southgate?

When he did, she revealed that she was sharing a home with another person. But she broke up with her lover and moved to Southgate.</p><p>She always supported Gareth. In 1996, when he faced defeat she was there for him. Alison is a constant supportive presence, but shuns the flashy WAG lifestyle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=alison-southgate-has-two-kids></span>Alison Southgate has two kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Alison Southgate largely remains out of the spotlight to focus on their two children.
