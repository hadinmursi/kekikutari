He has three other siblings and they were all raised in a Catholic household. His father Percy was a musician and provided well for his family, but he soon lost his job. Carrey had to quit school in order to help his family by working as a janitor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, throughout his childhood, Jim always had a talent for comedy. He was noticed by comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who signed the young man to open his tour performances. Dangerfield would later take Carrey to Las Vegas to perfect his comedy act.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-early-work>Jim Carrey's Early Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar49738112-1.jpg><p>After his stint in Las Verga, Carrey would later move to Hollywood where he performed in The Comedy Store in 1982. This was followed by his debuting on national television performing a bit on The Tonight Show.</p><p>Carrey then applied to NBC's <a href=# rel=nofollow>Saturday Night Live</a> as a cast member but was not selected for the part. But, not all was lost as from 1990 to 1994, he would become a regular cast member of the comedy series In Living Color.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carrey earned $25,000 per episode for his comedic work.</p><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-rise-to-fame>Jim Carrey's Rise to Fame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar50349143-1.jpg><p>In 1994, Carrey's illustrious career in Hollywood would begin when he was cast in the leading role in three separate movies. Each of the films, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective ($107 million), The Mask ($351 million), and Dumb and Dumber ($247 million), became a big commercial success.</p><p>Despite the success, Carrey only earned $350,000 and $540,000 from the first two films. That all changed for Dumb and Dumber though, as Carrey was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">paid $7 million for being the leading man.</a> Unfortunately, his co-star, Jeff Daniels, who was on board with Carrey to <a href=# rel=nofollow>not wear wigs for the film</a>, was not as lucky and <a href=# rel=nofollow>made only a fraction of what Carrey did for the film</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This did not deter <a href=# rel=nofollow>Daniels from working with Carrey again in the future</a>, however, as he would go on to narrate Carrey's book, Memoirs and Misinformation.</p><p>In 1995, Jim portrayed one of the villains, The Riddler, in the superhero movie Batman: Forever ($336 million). The movie received mixed reviews but was a box-office success. His second role that year was the comedy sequel Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls ($212 million).

The movie became the second-highest-grossing film of 2020, bringing in over $300 million. It was also the highest-grossing video game film adaptation in the United States and Canada, surpassing Detective Pikachu.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The last TV role Carrey was a part of was Kidding, a comedy-drama TV series. Its second and final season aired in February-March 2020.</p><p>While Carrey has decided to slow down his acting career, he has made cameos both in The Weeknd's music video, Out of Time, and his short, the Dawn FM Experience.</p><p>Carrey has also dedicated much of his time over the past decade to his art. While the bulk of his fortune is from his acting career, the prints of Carrey's work go for $800 and the originals go for much more. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The art is not done to make an income, however</a>, as Carrey donates anything he makes to charity. It is done instead to "free" the actor.
