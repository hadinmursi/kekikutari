May there be peace in our hearts, our homes, and in the world.”</p><p>Pink also shared a video of herself and daughter Willow Sage, 12, singing prayers together as they lit the menorah’s first candle. After the duo finished, they hugged. The camera then panned over to her son, Jameson Moon, 6, who sweetly wished his mom a “happy Hanukkah.”</p><p>Pink shares her two children with husband <a href=#><strong>Carey Hart</strong></a>, whom she wed in 2008. The family of four have celebrated both Hanukkah and Christmas over the years.</p><p>“Happy Holidays from The Hart Family ♥️🎄♥️🕎🥰,” Pink captioned a holiday photo of her whole family in December 2022. “Wherever you are, I hope you’re surrounded with love and gratitude. Here’s to a healthy year ahead 🥰.”</p><p>One month prior, Pink showed her followers some of the tasty treats she likes to make for her loved ones during the holiday season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Pink-Sings-While-She-and-Her-Family-Light-Their-Menorah-on-1st-Night-of-Hanukkah-2.jpg><p>“For those of you just tuning in, I am Pink, and I am making kugel, which is a Jewish noodle dish,” she said in a November 2022 Instagram Live. “I thought it was a very appropriate time to be making a Jewish dish.”</p><p>As she made the casserole dish, Pink opened up about her family’s favorite Hanukkah traditions.</p><p>“You do kugel, and then you can do some Challah bread, which is really fun for the kids to braid the bread,” she explained. “The six braid is really good, and then we do potato pancakes and then we read the book The Latke Who Couldn’t Stop Screaming by Lemony Snicket, which is our favorite book and a very fun tradition for us.”</p><p>In addition to sharing festive meals, Pink and her daughter also love to sing together. In November 2020, Willow joined her mom for a duet of “The Christmas Song” as part of Disney’s Holiday Singalong. “They know that Santa’s on his way, he’s loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh,” Willow sang while her mom looked on with pride.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Willow has since taken her love of singing to the next level. As Pink hit the road for her <a href=#>Summer Carnival 2023 Tour</a>, Willow joined her on stage in June to sing their song “Cover Me In Sunshine.”</p><p>“So proud of Willz to get up on stage w/ mama @pink !!!!! Must be a surreal moment for mama to have w/ her lil girl on stage 😢,” Hart, 48, gushed via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “Looks like [the] 1st show of the tour kicked ass!!!!! Can’t wait to catch up [at the] end of this month and see for myself. Summer is grind time ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapoZ6gerS1zaCqZq%2BYnrmmecKeo56aopbBqrrGZmisrF2jtqi002amn2WYlru2t8qan2avmam1brTEq2SfmZ2eubp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
