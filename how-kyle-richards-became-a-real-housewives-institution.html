In addition to being an actress — she starred in last year’s Halloween Ends and has a role in the upcoming Christmas movie The Holiday Exchange — she’s also a producer, and she’s “very excited” about several scripted projects she’s currently working on. “I love having a creative role behind and in front of the camera,” she tells Us. “I’ve been acting since I was a child, so I’m never going to give that up.”</p><p>A lesser Housewife might have cracked under the pressure — and many have, but Kyle keeps forging ahead in spite of feuds, cast shakeups and repeated character assassination attempts. “I just want people to know that I am always sharing my true and authentic self,” she tells Us when asked what she wants her reality TV legacy to be.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>There is no Real Housewives Hall of Fame (yet), but if there were, Kyle would be the first inductee.</p><p>For more with the Reality Stars of the Year, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, <a href=# rel=noopener>on stands now</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bor12gxq2xjKugnKCRp7G0ecGempqllWKubr7EmqNmoJ%2BqwKbDyK%2BcrGWZo8C1tdOuq6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
