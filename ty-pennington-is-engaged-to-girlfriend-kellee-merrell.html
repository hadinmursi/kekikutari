Now, losing a job is NOWHERE near losing everything but this much is true: exactly one year ago, I was asked to return to a job that I had done successfully – for almost a decade. This time around though, my position was given to someone else.”</p><p class=p1>He continued, “Not gonna lie, my ego took a huge punch to the gut. It stung. And it left me SO confused. I began doubting my talent, my experience and my overall belief in myself. But the job was never about me! … Honestly, it WAS and always will be, one of the best experiences I’ve ever had.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Instead of hosting, Pennington appeared on the HGTV revival as a special guest before finding a new gig on the network’s&nbsp;<i>Battle on the Beach&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Ty Breaker.</i></p><p class=p3>“To put a happy ending on this sad little narcissistic story…. saying yes to a lesser job made me remember to appreciate those bigger jobs when you get them,” he continued in the post. “Fast forward to one year later, I’m working on a new show that I helped create. … So please, be patient. Have faith. Something good is coming – just give it time. Believe in yourself; you deserve to be as good as you KNOW you can be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsV2lsq%2B6yKeeraeeYra0ecSnnpqflZl6tbuMoKCrpJantqa6w2ainqScmrJuucSrqZ6knGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
