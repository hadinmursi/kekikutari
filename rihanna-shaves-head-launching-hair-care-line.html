However, her newly buzzed may have been motivated by criticism, with fans accusing her of using a wig to promote her new products, which doesn’t give consumers true insight into how they work on natural as opposed to synthetic.</p><p>On Sunday, the singer was seen in New York City, proudly showcasing her naturally short curls. Rihanna navigated through a sea of photographers and admirers, dressed in a vintage John Galliano mink fur coat from 1998, paired with black high-waisted trousers and clear strappy heels. Her look was completed with dark sunglasses and a Louis Vuitton purse.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rihanna-and-asap-rocky-attending-the-uk-fashion-awards-2019.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="ASAP Rocky Calls Out Drake’s Obsession With Rihanna In New Song As They Consider More Kids ">ASAP Rocky Calls Out Drake’s Obsession With Rihanna In New Song As They Consider More Kids</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Drake appeared to reference Rihanna on his last album, so ASAP is now firing back.</p><h2 id=rihanna-rsquo-s-hairstyle-may-be-a-response-to-backlash>Rihanna’s Hairstyle May Be A Response To Backlash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/rihanna-in-front-of-the-paparazzi.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rihanna’s choice to wear her hair naturally on this outing appeared to be a strategic move, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Us Weekly </a><a href=#>notes.</a> Just a week earlier, she had faced backlash for donning a wig while promoting her latest business venture, Fenty Hair.</p><p>In an Instagram post made last week, RiRi shared her enthusiasm for launching Fenty Hair.
