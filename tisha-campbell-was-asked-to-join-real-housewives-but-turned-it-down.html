In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Campbell, 55, was asked whether she’d ever consider joining The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.
“I have been asked,” Campbell revealed. “But right now is not the time. I’m not anti, it’s just not the time.”
The Martin alum candidly admitted that she likes her privacy a little bit too much to be the latest addition to the Bravo universe."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m not anti, it’s just not the time.”</p><p>The <i>Martin</i> alum candidly admitted that she likes her privacy a little bit too much to be the latest addition to <a href=#>the Bravo universe</a>.</p><p>“I’m not as bold to share like that,” Campbell said. “You have to be bold.”</p><p>Still, she gave shout-outs to former reality stars who were able to transition from their roots into bigger and better things.</p><p>“People like [<i>Basketball Wives</i> star] <a href=#><strong>Tami Roman</strong></a> parlayed it into a different career,” Campbell noted of Roman’s acting career. “[<i>Love & Hip Hop: New York</i> star] <a href=#><strong>Cardi B</strong></a> parlayed it into a different career. I love that. Big ups to anybody who does that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tisha-Campbell-Has-Been-Asked-to-Join-Real-Housewives-But-Now-Is-Not-the-Time-2.jpg><p>She continued, “There can be downsides. But there can be upsides too. And those two are perfect examples.”</p><p>Campbell also credited <a href=#><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a>, who used her<i> Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> fame to nab acting roles on shows like NBC’s <i>The New Normal</i> and a starring role on Broadway as Mama Morton in <i>Chicago</i>.</p><p>Just because Campbell isn’t ready to star on the <i>Real Housewives</i> herself, don’t think she’s not on the couch watching with the rest of us. She noted, “I love a good reality show.”</p><p>However, Campbell added, they don’t always go down easy.</p><p>“Sometimes it can leave you feeling like, ‘I didn’t want to see these people’s business,’” she said. “Whereas watching a sitcom, you’re just laughing and it’s a good feeling.”</p><p>On that topic, the former <i>My Wife and Kids</i> star recently put her sitcom expertise to good use on the Tuesday, April 30, season 2 finale of NBC’s <i>Lopez vs. Lopez</i>, where she played George Lopez’s therapist Dr. Glenda Brenda.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I loved being on that show,” Campbell <a href=#>exclusively told<i> Us </i></a>about the experience. “I loved working with George. I hadn’t had a chance to work with George in years.”</p><p>She continued, “He’s so quick on his feet. You have to be quick with him. The ad libs will come, and you have to be ready. He’s just so phenomenal.”</p><p><i>Lopez vs. Lopez</i> is available to stream on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuiq5iWeqStzKmZnqScYsSiv4yaqqSdlGLBsHnJqKCnZaKarq15x6isrJ2nnsOmv4ybrK1lpKq%2Fr7HDZqCtZZSkxK97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
