In the short video, he talks about wanting to perform since he was young but needing the confidence to do it. After finding it he said he was able to become the person he wants. “My smile shows the world who I am. What does your smile show the world?” The full commercial will premiere during the Grammy’s this Sunday, February 10.</p><p>It’ll be a big night for the “Stitches” singer.&nbsp;He is also rumored to be performing a duet with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>. After she posted some backstage rehearsal selfies with his name visible, he posted a cryptic Instagram of the two of them walking arm in arm on February 7. The song they’re meant to sing? “Islands in the Stream” by none other than Cyrus’ godmother Dolly Parton.</p><p>We’ll have to wait ’til Sunday to see Mendes try his hand at country.
