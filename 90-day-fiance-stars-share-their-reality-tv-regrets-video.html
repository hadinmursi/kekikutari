It’s given me such success that I could never imagine. I just turned 56, and I feel blessed by the show. I love the network, and I’m optimistic about the future.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Colt Johnson</strong></a> feels the same way. “It changed me in so many ways, good and bad,” the Las Vegas native, 35, tells Us of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. “But at the end of the day, I like the person I’ve become and I’m hopeful for the future.”</p><p>His <a href=#>wife,<strong> Vanessa Guerra</strong></a>, on the other hand, does regret her last season “for sure.” She explains to Us, “I came off as someone I’m totally not, but I think I’m OK with this [one].” Guerra slept with Colt while he was dating<a href=#><strong> Jess Caroline</strong></a>, she recalled. “I regret that, for sure.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Big-Ed-Colt-Johnson-90-Day-Fiance-Stars-Share-Their-Reality-TV-Regrets-002.jpg><p>The former software engineer agrees, adding that he likes “everything [else he] did” while filming — even wearing a Speedo in an infamous 2020 scene. “I think my choice in outfits were always appropriate to the scene and the tone of the scene, especially the beach scene,” Colt says. “No regrets on that one. I get a lot of compliments. Not many, mostly haters, but some compliments and I like them the best.”</p><p>For more TLC personalities reflecting on their time on the show, from<a href=#><strong> Molly Hopkins</strong> </a>to <a href=#><strong>Danielle Mullins</strong></a>, watch the video above.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaHBpZZSWxm6yyJqlnJ1dqMGivtJmqqGZopp6tbTEoqlmqpWWuarA2Garr2WimrSzsdOsZK%2BhlJq8cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
