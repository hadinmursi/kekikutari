The Buffalo Bills picked him in the first round of the 1973 National Football League Draft. After discovering that a medical issue causing his erratic heartbeat was not life threatening, he was awarded All-Rookie honours. The Buffalo Bills’ rushing attack led the NFL in yards, yards per carry, and rushing touchdowns in 1973, according to Pro Football Focus. DeLamielleure was perhaps the most important member of the “Electric Company,” the Buffalo Bills’ offensive line that paved the way for O.J. Simpson to rush for 2,003 yards in 1973, the first player ever to do so and the only player ever to do so in a 14-game schedule. DeLamielleure died in a car accident in his hometown of Buffalo on November 8, 2017. The 14-game record for running yards is still held by the team with the most in the league (3,088 yards). Just the 1978 New England Patriots have surpassed that total, and they did it in only 16 games. The “quadruple championship” was achieved by O. J. Simpson, who finished first in all four main running categories in the NFL. In addition, he has the longest career streak in the NFL. Simpson’s rushing total of 14 yards in 2003 is still the 14-game record (Eric Dickerson, Barry Sanders, Terrell Davis, Chris Johnson and Adrian Peterson achieved their marks in 16 games). Joe was also a member of the kickoff return unit that blocked for Wallace Francis, who was the NFL’s leading returner with two touchdowns. DeLamielleure spent his entire professional football career in Buffalo as a member of the kickoff return team’s wedge. The next season, in 1974, the Bills improved to 9-5 and qualified for the postseason for the first time. DeLamielleure was named to the All-Pro second team. In 1975, the Buffalo Bills had one of the most powerful offences of the decade, putting up a 14-3 record. While on way to an 8-6 record, they topped the NFL in eleven categories, including total offence (including rushing), running average (including points), touchdowns (including passing), and touchdown passes (including passing). In addition, the offensive line allowed the fewest sacks in the AFC. Simpson, who is the driving force behind the “Electric Company,” wins his second “quadruple championship” in three years and has the longest NFL career streak. Individually, DeLamielleure has been selected to the All-Pro first team. 1976 Simpson continues to lead the NFL in running, while DeLamielleure is selected to the NFL’s first-team All-Pro squad. 1977 Because Simpson was hurt in the middle of the season, the Bills have relied on passing more, and they now lead the NFL in passing yards and throw the most passes. 1978 Following Simpson’s trade, Bills running back Terry Miller has taken over and is now ranked ninth in the NFL in rushing yards. He was chosen to the All-Pro team six times, and he was also selected to the Pro Bowl six times.&nbsp;<p>In 1975, he was awarded Offensive Lineman of the Year by the NFL Players Association. In 1973, he was named Co-Offensive Linemen of the Year by the 1000 Yard Rusher Club in Columbus, Ohio, an honour bestowed upon him. Joe was named the NFL’s Most Valuable Offensive Lineman in 1977, receiving the Forrest Gregg Award. In 1980, DeLamielleure was transferred to the Cleveland Browns, where he played defensive end for Brian Sipe, who went on to win his second NFL MVP award. DeLamielleure becomes the first player in NFL history to block for both a 2,000-yard rusher and a 4,000-yard quarterback in the same game. DeLamielleure’s teammates (Jackie Slater, Doug Smith, Irv Pankey, Kevin Glover, and Tom Nalen) were the only ones to accomplish so since (along with Sip Hamilton and Tom Nalen) who were also NFL MVPs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-delamielleure-net-worth-7-million></span>Joe Delamielleure Net Worth : $ 7 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lets check out updated 2021 Joe Delamielleure Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :</p><span><b style=background-color:#fff;font-size:1.1em>Joe Delamielleure’s Salary /&nbsp;</b></span><b style=background-color:#fff;font-size:1.1em>Income</b><b style=background-color:#fff;font-size:1.1em>:</b><p><span style=background-color:#fff><span style=font-size:16px><br></span><span><b>Per Year:</b>&nbsp;$ 4,00,000</span></span><br><span style=background-color:#fff><span><br></span><span><b>Per Month:</b>&nbsp;$ 32,000</span></span><br><span style=background-color:#fff><span><br></span><span><b>Per Week:</b>&nbsp;$ 8,000</span></span><br><span><span><span style=background-color:#fff><br></span></span></span></p><table style=border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;width:653px><tbody><tr><td style=padding:0><b><span style=background-color:#fff>Per Day:</span></b></td><td style=padding:0><b><span style=background-color:#fff>Per Hour:</span></b></td><td style=padding:0><b><span style=background-color:#fff>Per Minute:</span></b></td><td style=padding:0><b><span style=background-color:#fff>Per Second:</span></b></td></tr><tr><td style=padding:0><span style=background-color:#fff>$ 1140</span></td><td style=padding:0><span style=background-color:#fff>$ 19</span></td><td style=padding:0><span style=background-color:#fff>$ 0.3</span></td><td style=padding:0><span style=background-color:#fff>$ 0.05</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-delamielleure-wiki></span>Joe Delamielleure Wiki<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><span style=background-color:#fff;color:#333;font-family:Arial;font-size:16px>﻿﻿﻿﻿</span><table style=border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;max-width:100%><tbody style=max-width:100%><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Net Worth</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>$7 Million</td></tr><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Date Of Birth</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>March 16, 1951</td></tr><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Place Of Birth</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Detroit, Michigan, USA</td></tr><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Height</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>6′ 3″ (1.91 m)</td></tr><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Profession</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Player of American football</td></tr><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Nicknames</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Joe Delamielleure, Delamielleure, Joe</td></tr><tr style=max-width:100%><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Star Sign</td><td style=font-size:14px;max-width:100%;padding:17px>Pisces</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-delamielleure-faq></span>Joe Delamielleure FAQ<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>How did Joe Delamielleure get so rich?</li><li>What is Joe Delamielleure Earning per day ?</li><li>Lets check out Joe Delamielleure Wife / Husand Net Worth ?</li><li>How much does Joe Delamielleure make per day?</li><li>How much Joe Delamielleure Net Worth ?</li><li>How Joe Delamielleure become rich ?</li><li>How does Joe Delamielleure make money ?</li><li>What is Joe Delamielleure Income ?</li><li>How much Joe Delamielleure Salary ?</li><li>How old is Joe Delamielleure Age ?</li><li>How tall is Joe Delamielleure Height ?</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfmnqlscuapKKdnKGytr7EZqWerF2svLPAx2agp5uforJuv8ClmKuxXZqus7rIp56sZZKevKi%2BwKmfsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
