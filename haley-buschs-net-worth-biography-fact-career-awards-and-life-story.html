She’s the oldest female of the children, so they said she’s always taking care of them. They also mention that she’s the clumsiest of the group.</p><p>“I guess it’s just because I’m the oldest girl,” she said. “I kind of just fall into that role.”</p><p>Billy Jr. says that Haley is always making food for everyone, and will often do things like put tuna salad in the fridge just in case anyone else is hungry.</p><p>“Haley has a strong work ethic, she’s a lot like me,” Haley’s mom, Christi Busch, said in the video. “She’s a nurturer, she works hard, she does everything the right way, and I just know I can count on her.”</p><p>Gussie, who is 24, said in the video that if the group is out too late, Haley is the one to tell them it’s time to go home.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Haley has been acting since she was young.

She first mentioned that they all love the sampling side but then referenced her past as an actress.</p><p>“I grew up as an actress, so I’ve been acting a lot my whole life,” she said. “So in the business, I’m more on the creative side, which is nice because I can kind of utilize my creativity and acting on doing social media and branding, so that’s what I’m most interested in.”</p><p>When asked if they could describe the family in three words, they said the three words are “passionate, loving, and fiery.”</p><p>Tune in to the premiere of Busch Family Brewed on MTV at 9 p.m. on Thursday, March 5.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6yHawYjUJi/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=she-keeps-a-%e2%80%9chalf-as%e2%80%9d-vegan-diet></span>She Keeps a “Half-a*s” Vegan Diet<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B8m4g5gjTf7/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading</p><p>Haley keeps a “half-a*s vegan diet.” Her brothers say that diet keeps them in check and helps keep them a little bit on the leaner side.</p><p>Her Instagram showcases her love for animals.
