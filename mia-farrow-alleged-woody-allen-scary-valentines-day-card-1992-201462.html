Sitting with correspondent Steve Kroft, Allen discussed the bitter custody battle that was at play with his ex-partner Mia Farrow at the time.

The discussion surrounding <strong>Dylan Farrow</strong>‘s open letter alleging<strong> Woody Allen</strong> sexually abused her at age 7 prompted CBS to dig into its vault Wednesday, Feb. 5 and upload its <a href=# rel=noopener>1992&nbsp;60 Minutes interview</a> with the Oscar-winning director.</p><p>Sitting with correspondent <strong>Steve Kroft</strong>, Allen discussed the bitter custody battle that was at play with his ex-partner <strong>Mia Farrow</strong> at the time. In 1992, Farrow learned of Allen’s relationship with <strong>Soon-Yi Previn</strong>, the Rosemary Baby star’s adopted daughter with <strong>Andre Previn</strong>. The New York City resident told Kroft he feared for his life and even shared one not-so-happy holiday card that truly made him believe Farrow was out to get him.</p><p>“She sent me a Valentine card,” the director said, stuttering in recollection. “She didn’t send it to me; she gave it to me. And I said, ‘Oh, thanks,’ you know. And I went downstairs, I got into my car and I opened it up, and there…was a very, very, very chilling Valentine, meticulously worked on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mia-Farrow-Allegedly-Gave-Woody-Allen-Scary-Valentines-Day-Card-Back-In-1992-Threatened-Directors-Life-3.jpg><p>“One hesitates to say psychotically worked on,” he reasoned. The card, he explained, was “a Victorian Valentine and photo of the family, and through all the kids was thrust needles and a steak knife stuck through the heart of the thing.”</p><p>“And I got scared because, you know, that was–that was one of the times that I thought, ‘My God, this is really’–you know to–if you look at the thing, it’s quite frightening.” The director added that he feared for his life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Mia-Farrow-Allegedly-Gave-Woody-Allen-Scary-Valentines-Day-Card-Back-In-1992-Threatened-Directors-Life-2.jpg><p>“She’s threatened my life many times,” Allen said in the interview. “I mean, she called me and threatened my–she’s threatened to have me killed and to kill me. And to–and to stick my eyes out, to stick my eyes out, to blind me because she became obsessed with Greek tragedy and–and felt that this–that that would be a fitting, you know, vengeance.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Allen told Kroft he took the threats seriously after he would receive phone calls late at night saying he was “going to be killed” and his eyes were “going to be put out.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Feb. 4, Allen’s attorney <strong>Elkan Abramowitz</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>appeared on the Today show</a> to defend his client. “[Woody’s] reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to Dylan,” Abramowitz shared. “She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia Farrow years ago, and the idea that she was molested was implanted in her by her mother and that memory is never going to go away. The fact that she says this now, that it happened 20 years ago is totally understandable.”</p><p>Farrow, 68, <a href=# rel=noopener>responded to her daughter’s letter</a> the same day and tweeted, “I love my daughter. I will always protect her.” The humanitarian added, “A lot of ugliness is going to be aimed at me. But this is not about me, it’s about her truth.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZFis6K%2B0aiuZpmcobKoscNmrqinlK56orjLnqVmq5OWv7p51Zqjnqaknrumv4ydmLJlk5a%2FpXmQcnBrZWJlfnWCkWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
