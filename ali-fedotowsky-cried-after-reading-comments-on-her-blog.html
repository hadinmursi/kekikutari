“I just, like, cried my eyes out reading some comments on my blog,” she said in her Instagram Stories video on Friday, June 21. “I’m gonna try not to cry in this because I don’t want to."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Why can’t I do it on my own? Why do I need someone to help raise my children? These are toxic things to think and worse to say.”</p><p>Fedotowsky shared that her nanny, Jessica, was partly hired because of her blog site, adding: “Some of you may know this and some of you may not but running this website is a full-time job. It’s more than a full-time job!”</p><p>Later in the post, the former E! News correspondent admitted to hiring a “part-time employee,” Madi, to help run her website. “She helps me do lots of things like come up with content ideas, sends out emails, adds some links to items I talk about in my blog, adds photos to my blog post, and most importantly edits all of my blog posts,” she shared.</p><p>Fedotowsky also confessed to hiring a photographer for her photos and flying in family to care for her children when needed, among other things.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Fedotowsky aimed to shed light on how having help has benefitted her, not all were amused by the candid post. One commenter wrote how there was “something that just does not come off natural or sincere” about the post, and another fan said they “found myself shaking my head” after reading the blog entry. A third reader said it was “not realistic for the vast majority of moms to afford the help you say we must have,” whereas another person argued the TV personality didn’t “need a 8 paragraph blog post to justify getting help.”</p><p>Fedotowsky and Mannos, 35, <a href=#>wed in 2017</a>. They share <a href=#>daughter Molly, 2, and son Riley, 12 months</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapJlis6awzq2msKubrnqkvsiem2aZlqmys3nRnpidoZ6ceqS7zKacp6yjYryveceeqWaanKS0cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
