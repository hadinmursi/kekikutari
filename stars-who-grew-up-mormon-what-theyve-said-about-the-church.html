Katherine Heigl, Amy Adams and Ryan Gosling are among the A-listers that grew up in the Mormon church.
Heigl’s family converted to the religion after her brother Jason died in 1986 of injuries suffered in a car accident.
“Both my parents felt a great desire for answers, and they found an answer in the Mormon church — or answers they could live with, anyway, because there really are none,” the Grey’s Anatomy alum told Vanity Fair in January 2008."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I still have enough Mormon in me — not a lot, but enough — that I wanted to keep that a little bit sacred,” she told the outlet.</p><p>Adams, for her part, has also been candid about how the religion influenced her worldview.</p><p>“I grew up as a Mormon and that had more of an impact on my values than my beliefs. I’m afraid I will always feel the weight of a lie,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Sun</a> in June 2013. “I’m very hard on myself anyway. Religious guilt carries over, too. You can’t really misbehave without feeling badly about it — at least, I can’t.”</p><p>The Enchanted star added that <a href=#>Mormonism’s strict rules</a> — which include a ban on drinking coffee and alcohol — remain a source of guilt.</p><p>“Even when I go out with friends and we <a href=#>go overboard at bars or clubs</a>, I wake up the next morning feeling a bit conflicted about having had too much fun,” she shared at the time.</p><p>Gosling, on the other hand, has said that he never identified with the theology, despite growing up in the church.</p><p>“I wasn’t really Mormon, my parents were,” <a href=#>the Notebook actor</a> told <a href=# rel=noopener>Beliefnet</a> in October 2007. “My <a href=#>mom was really cool.</a> She said, ‘This is an option, but this isn’t the only option. This is an idea, but this isn’t the only idea. You have to find your own truth.’ I never really could identify with it.”</p><p>The Canada native added that there were “good things” about his <a href=#>religious upbringing</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[It] socialized me at a young age,” he explained. “You have to pray in public, shake a lot of hands, talk in public, sing in church, stuff like that. It has definitely stayed with me.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see which celebrities grew up in the Mormon church — and what they’ve said about the religion:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKCfYrSzsdZmrKllnaS%2FrrvNZq6hmaRiwamx2K%2BcZquRnrFurcGorK1lpJ2ybq%2FHrqmcoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
