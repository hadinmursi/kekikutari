We have been through many highs and lows in our 24 years of marriage and as we navigate this new chapter in our lives, we will coparent our amazing children.” (Kim has since moved on with her boyfriend, <strong>Ken Palmer</strong>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former spouses’ divorce filing comes eight months after Ethan and <strong>Olivia Plath</strong> <a href=#>announced their own breakup</a> after five years of marriage. “Ethan and I have decided to go our separate ways,” Olivia, 26, wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>via Instagram</a> in October 2023. “I have ambivalent memories of us being 18 years old, innocently dreaming of forever – but the partner you choose is a reflection of the world you want to live in, and at 18 I didn’t know who I was or what kind of life I wanted to create for myself.”</p><p>She went on to write: “There were good moments and I want to remember and honor those. We fell in love as children and are going our separate ways as adults. Wiser, older, and braver. We will be OK.”</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram statement</a> of his own, Ethan added: “It just didn’t work between us, though Lord knows we both gave it all we had. It seemed we were constantly pulling each other in opposite directions in life with different goals.” In joint divorce docs filed in February, the two listed their date of separation as February 25, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnZyYvK6xjK2mZqiclsGpwsilo56rXaC2rnnPpZitoF2btq2x0madqKpdmba3u9GcnGaeoqS6bq7Aq6myZaChrrW0jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
