Happy shopping!</p><p>If you find yourself in a fitness rut, there’s nothing quite like <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">a new pair of leggings</a> to help amp up your motivation! Scoring some fresh activewear usually inspires a renewed interest in the gym — after all, we feel guilty wasting our gear. The only issue standing in our way? Well, that would be where exactly to start shopping!</p><p>Despite common misconceptions, you don’t have to spend big bucks to get a high-quality pair of leggings that will enhance your workout. Take this <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">pair from Houmous</a> that’s available on Amazon, for example. They come in a trendy, fun camo print — and you can even snag the style in a sleek short version!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Houmous-Womens-High-Waisted-Pattern-Yoga-Pants-7-8-Length-Leggings-Deep-Grey-Camo.jpg><p><strong>Get the </strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><strong><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Houmous Women’s High Waisted Pattern Yoga Pants 7/8 Length Leggings</a> for <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$22</a>, available at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, August 18, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></span></p><p>These <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">high-waisted leggings from Houmous</a> are made from a four-way stretch fabric that shoppers describe as “buttery” smooth and soft to the touch. Each pair has plenty of stretch to it so they can fit your body like a glove, and the thick waistband has tummy-control capabilities that owners seriously appreciate.</p><p>The leggings come in <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">three different colors</a>, all of which have the same chic and subtle print. There’s Deep Green Camo, Deep Grey Camo and Deep Blue Camo. Each pair of the leggings is full-length and has a pocket on the side that can easily house your phone or other essential items. But if you like to show off your legs in workout wear or often get overheated during a sweat session, you can purchase the camo print in a shorter version!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ALWAYS-Women-Workout-Yoga-Shorts.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">ALWAYS Women Workout Yoga Shorts</span></a><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">$13</a>, available at Amazon!

No matter which pair you pick up, just know that you won’t let these leggings sit at the bottom of your gym bag for weeks.
