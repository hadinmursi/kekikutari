And I’m happy to get that ball rolling, because what I hope happens is that next year and the next year and the next year, we will have presence. And the presence will grow not only to Asian-Americans, you know, from yellow to brown, but to all our other sisters and brothers,” she said. “Our First Nations sisters and brothers. Our sisters and brothers of different sizes and different shapes. If I can be a part of that change, like, yeah, let’s celebrate it.”</p><p>She also added she was happy to move into a leading role and out of the best friend role she played on Grey’s from 2005 to 2014.</p><p>“I am absolutely aware of the significance and take it very seriously because we need it. Not only just for my community — and hopefully what that means to be represented and seen — but also for culture,” she told the Times. “We’re a part of it. Let us not only see ourselves, but let others see us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJympamoenN8kHFkrJmemb%2Biec6hZJuqmaO0tHnHnqlmqJGnsq%2FA0maYrGWYmr9usMCtnKxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
