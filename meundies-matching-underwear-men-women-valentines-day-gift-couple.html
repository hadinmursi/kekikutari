These undies are available in so many amazing prints — from plaid, to coffee cups, to cats, to doughnuts. You can pick any individual pair out for just yourself, but if you’re looking for something for Valentine’s Day, you absolutely must check out the new collection too — featuring three new prints: Heart to Heart, Hot Stuff, and Roses Are Red!</p><p>These undies aren’t only cute, but insanely comfortable — and eco-friendly! They’re made with Lenzing MicroModal, a soft fiber sustainably sourced from beechwood trees. Want a full outfit of this unbeatable comfort?
