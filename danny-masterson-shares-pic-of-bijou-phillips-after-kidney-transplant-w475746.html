I have been waiting for this day to come for a long time,” she captioned the photo that showed her in bed, wearing a hospital gown. “My donor is a dream come true, such an amazing guy, so kind, he blows me away everyday! Three years ago he heard people where getting checked and he called, but he kept calling and going in and getting tested! He rolled with the punches from day one and the struggles to get insurance to approve it. It’s been a wild ride. Fate finds you, he is a perfect match.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Phillips, who has not revealed the name of her donor, added that she had some complications related to dialysis, explaining, “I got an infection and am on my second catheter.

And my dream come true Donor… This is gonna be such an amazing birthday coming up! A new birth… New start! Here is to good health, and gratitude…”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuapp6ueq6t0q2cq6ufo3q0tMCrnKxloJ6wbrvFZpmiop%2BqerG0yKWjoqijYq6nwMSrZKShlKOyunnTq5inq6Chrq%2FAjLBrcG1naYNw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
