Many have gone on to try and repeat her steps and become overnight sensations, but they don't have that ‘it’ factor. They don't leave people wanting more. Emma does; she is a master at it, and honestly, she doesn't even try. It's just who she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-chamberlain-39-s-makeup>Emma Chamberlain's Makeup</h2><p>Emma Chamberlain is the new face of Lancome cosmetics.
