According to a new report by <a href=#>New York magazine</a>, <strong><a href=#>President Donald Trump</a></strong>’s former campaign manager, <strong>Corey Lewandowski</strong>, leaked the domestic violence allegations against White House aid <strong>Rob Porter</strong>&nbsp;because he was jealous of his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, <strong>Hope Hicks</strong>.</p><p>Porter resigned from his position in the White House on February 7 after allegations of physical abuse from his two ex-wives, <strong>Colbie Holderness</strong> and<strong> Jennifer Willoughby</strong>, made headlines. Willoughby told the publication that back in January, Porter asked her to delete a blog post that accused him (without directly using his name) of domestic violence because someone was going to “send it to the media.”</p><p>“He did not name names, but he implied that there was a former staffer from the White House who was unhappy with him and was out to get him and take him down and somehow had gotten wind of my blog post … He’s demanding that I take it down and telling me that this former staffer is going to send it to the media,”&nbsp;Willoughby explained, revealing that she believes he was referring to Lewandowski.</p><p>Prior to the domestic violence accusations, the Daily Mail reported that Hicks, who was White House communications director at the time, was dating Porter. In <strong>Michael Wolff</strong>’s book Fire and Fury, he claimed that Lewandowski had also dated Hicks.</p><p>A source told New York magazine that Lewandowski “got wind that [Hicks] was dating Porter, and he could not handle that.” Another source told the publication that “there were still raw feelings.”</p><p>Hicks, meanwhile, also recently stepped down from the administration. The New York Times reported on February 28 that Hicks <a href=#>resigned</a> from her position as communications director.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to&nbsp;President Trump,” she said in a statement to&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;at the time. “I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.”</p><p>Trump had nothing but good things to say about Hicks in a statement to Us on the same day: “Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years. She is as smart and thoughtful as they come, a truly great person I will miss having her by my side, but when she approached me about pursuing other opportunities, I totally understood. I am sure we will work together again in the future.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawmaNisLC%2BxLJkpZ2nlrulu9asoqJlmpqurbvUrGSorpWnerO7wWanqKqkmr9utM6pnGagmZi4tHnApaOen5WZerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
