“They see themselves as soulmates,” a source exclusively reveals in the newest issue of Us Weekly about Reeves and Grant’s dynamic.
According to the insider, the couple prefer to keep their relationship low-key.
“They’re shy by nature so there’s no overintensity or jealousy on either side,” the source notes. “Alexander appreciates that Keanu is a total gentleman who encourages her to pursue her passions, while he says she’s one of the kindest people he’s ever met."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They went on to collaborate on <a href=#>Reeves’ books Ode to Happiness and Shadows</a> and opened their own publishing company, X Artists Books.</p><p>“The book was made as a surprise, by me, for Keanu, as a private gift,” Grant told British Vogue of Ode to Happiness in 2020. “All our friends sitting in the room got the giggles when I gave it to him — they said, ‘Please publish it!’ So that’s how we got into publishing.”</p><p>After developing a friendship, Reeves and Grant <a href=#>took their relationship to the next level</a>. They were public with their romance in November 2019, which is when a second source told Us that the pair were “dating for years” and “it wasn’t a secret.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Keanu-Reeves-and-Girlfriend-Alexandra-Grant-See-Themselves-as-Soulmates.jpg><p>Grant recently <a href=#>offered insight into her romance</a> with Reeves when she discussed their joint interest in art.</p><p>“My work is much more of a private performance, but I have a text that I interpret in the studio into a painting, into an object,” Grant explained to People in September 2023. “He takes the text in private and then turns it into a performance in public. … There’s a relationship. We’re both, at the heart, readers and researchers. We both care about people and we care about characters.”</p><p>Another insider told Us last year that Reeves and Grant are “typically homebodies” who <a href=#>prefer “quiet nights alone or small get-togethers”</a> with their friends.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Keanu-Reeves-and-Girlfriend-Alexandra-Grant-See-Themselves-as-Soulmates-featuere.jpg><p>“Things are great between them. They’re very happy together,” the source shared in November 2023, adding that the twosome make an “amazing” match. “[They are] both very relaxed and casual by nature.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Reeves and Grant <a href=#>made a rare red carpet appearance</a> at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Gala in Los Angeles.
