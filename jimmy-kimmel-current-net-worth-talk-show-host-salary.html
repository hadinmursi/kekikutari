During that time he has had amazing guests on and only encounted a few glitches with interview along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Because of this, Kimmel has gotten himself a loyal following of viewers. This helps with the Nielsen ratings so that a contact worth a whopping $15 million per year could be negotiated for hosting his talk show.</p><p>Making this kind of cash has allowed Kimmel to invest it wisely, with real estate being a favored way. And if the ratings remain stable or climb, Kimmel will likely receive a larger salary the next time negotiations roll around, meaning that much more can be invested in.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-has-a-50-million-net-worth>Jimmy Kimmel Has A $50 Million Net Worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar48630833-1.jpg><p>As one of the most popular hosts on television, and as someone who has been in the entertainment industry for years now, Jimmy Kimmel is a star that millions of TV fans are familiar with.

In 2004, Jimmy paid $2.175 million for a home one block from the beach in Hermosa Beach, California," according to Celebrity Net Worth. "He bought a second home in Hermosa in 2014 for $2.25 million.

Not only that, but more opportunities were beginning to open themselves up for him. This is initially how he was making a ton of money in the industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During that same time, Kimmel also co-created and lent his voice to the hit series CrankYankers.

I have moments where I go, 'I cannot do this anymore.' And I have moments where I go, 'What am I gonna do with my life if I'm not doing this anymore?' It's a very complicated thing," Kimmel explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went on to explain, "And there are practical considerations, and there are family and friend considerations and co-worker considerations. And eventually, I am going to have to stop doing this. I'm not going to do this forever. I would not be honest at all if I said that I have decided one way or the other.
