In Battle On The Dancefloor the dancers must be able to do both.</span></p><p><strong>Interviewer: How is the atmosphere mutual?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Dan Karaty:</strong> I’ve known&nbsp;</span><span>Dennis</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Timor</span><span>&nbsp;for years. The good thing about Dennis is that he looks at the story behind the dancers and it provides a link with them. Timor is a talented dancer and he is now participating in this show great. Also&nbsp;</span><span>Pip</span><span>&nbsp;‘s a good addition to the program She and her friend Pim were able to surprise me during Dance Dance Dance, she looks at the overall picture of the performances, she does not go well on the technical side, Timor and I are ahead of it. together we feel so happy that it often seems almost no work.</span></p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;www.televizier.nl</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fma6vecqaqZqsqWKvqrvGq5ipoKlirqixjJ%2BYpqGcrnq4tcWeZKedpGLEsL7ToWSdmZ6Ytq%2BzjJqlnWWdpMOqsdI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
