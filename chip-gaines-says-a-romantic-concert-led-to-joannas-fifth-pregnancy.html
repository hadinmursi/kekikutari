WE ARE PREGNANT) @joannagaines,” he wrote.</p><p>Back in October, the Waco, Texas, residents responded to pregnancy rumors shortly after they announced <a href=#>that they would be ending their HGTV series.</a></p><p>“There’s so many [rumors], even leading up to it — I had this skincare line, so I’m leaving. It made it look like I was doing my own thing and Chip didn’t even know about it. That was just a big rumor,” Joanna, 39, told Entertainment Tonight at the time. “That our marriage is on the rocks…I was pregnant. Its funny when you start hearing this stuff. I was like, ‘I guess people can just make stuff up.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Chip added on the Today show: “For us, the most important thing in the world is Jo and I’s relationship, followed very quickly by these four beautiful kids [of ours]. We didn’t want to push it, to redline it for so long that we woke up and realized we are at a point of no return. We wanted to take a step back and focus on what is absolutely the most important thing to us.”</p><p>The Magnolia Market owners are already parents of Drake, 12, Ella, 11, Duke, 9, and Emmie, 7.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacoJmleqityKecrGWjlsa0ecBmqailkaPBqq%2BMnKanm5WnwW64xJ1kraddn7yius2aqmaemZvBqXnPq5ygppGjsLp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
