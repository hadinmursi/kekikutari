Throughout the season, Fezco also developed a sweet romance with <a href=#><strong>Maude Apatow</strong></a>’s Lexi Howard, though his brother’s death caused him to miss the premiere of her school play.</p><p>No details about how the series will handle Cloud’s death or Fezco’s fate have been revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJilpF2ks27Ax55kqaqfn7KkwNJmmKefpah6pLjOrptmoJGZeqq6jK2fnmWnpL%2Bsv4ybnJ%2Bnopp6qbXSZpuemaSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
