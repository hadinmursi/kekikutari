"If I struggled with an issue like this, I hope that I would be able to set that kind of example, because I'd want someone to set that example for me."</p><p>During their time on the NBC hit, "I was never asked a question about Zach's sexuality," Bell says, "but if a journalist ever asked me about anyone's sexuality, gay or straight, I'd probably slap them in the face and say, 'Check yourself.'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bell adds that Quinto, 34, "has always been sexy to me, even though I knew he was never interested in me. . .He has known exactly who he is since the day I met him."</p><p>The House of Lies actress is a lifelong LGBT supporter, particularly in relation to same-sex marriage. "In about 10 years, knock on wood, I think we're going to be embarrassed as a nation about our behavior on this issue," she tells <a href=#>The Advocate</a>. "It's going to be exactly like what happened in 1970, when people were like, 'Whoa, 1960 sucked. We should've let everyone ride the bus."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jJucpaRdrLatsMuyZKmqn6qxbrvFZrGam5iWv7p50K6gp6yfYrOwvoycpqahnpx6sMHTZqeumpyesK3FjGtnamphbH9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
