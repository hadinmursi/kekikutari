At one time, Lohan was one of the most talked-about celebrities in the world as she was a successful pop star and she starred in many popular movies. Unfortunately, however, Lohan’s career hit the skids and she seemingly frittered away a lot of money. For that reason, she was worth only $800,000 at one point but according to celebritynetworth.com, Lohan’s current fortune amounts to $1.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Lindsay Lohan Ended Up With Her (Current) $800,000 Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=tara-reid-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-2-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tara Reid’s Net Worth Is $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years before she was linked to Travis Barker in 2009, Tara Reid seemingly was on top of the world since starring in American Pie made her internationally famous.
