Hint: She was feeling low and looking for a change. Relatable much?</p><p>“It’s so funny,” the star told the outlet. “I got the fringe as a sort of break-up haircut after I came really close to a job and didn’t get it. The next week I had another audition for [the television series] War of the Worlds and got the part. I can act better with a fringe, it’s my secret power!”</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a> in April, Jones told the outlet that she got the now-famous “break-up haircut” in December 2019. “Just before Christmas last year, I hadn’t got a job in a wee while, and then I got my fringe,” she said. “Then a week later I got the job, so I was like, ‘Oh, maybe that’s the only thing that’s getting me employed.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Daisy-Edgar-Jones-Bangs-Inline.jpg><p>According to the Harper’s Bazaar interview, Jones has been low key about maintaining the hairstyle, especially during the COVID-19 quarantine. Apparently, her roommate has helped her touch up the look using a trusty “pair of scissors.”</p><p>The War of the Worlds actress also took part in a stunning photo shoot for the English publication. The brunette beauty expertly posed in a variety of ethereal backdrops wearing luxury fashion labels like Miu Miu, Gucci, Prada and Fendi.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the actress doesn’t consider herself a photo shoot pro. “I haven’t done many shoots in my life, they’re still so surreal to me,” she said. “I was trying not to look awkward. I treat it like I’m playing a character, it’s worse when you’re yourself. You should see my school photos… so uncomfortable and greasy.”</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6y1unnDmqCssV2asait0WahqKaVqHqkrculqmaglad6o63NoKpmmV2Xv6atyq6nZqCRnr%2BkwdNmm56skZ65tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
